0,Aer Lingus,2,“terrible customer service”,26th March 2025,False," Absolutely terrible customer service. Tried to upgrade from economy to business. Impossible to reach a person who could help, let phone ring for 52 minutes and gave up. Chat was just as bad as the AI could not help.

1,Air France,10,"""excellent customer service""",28th March 2025,True,   My son was travelling on Kids Solo as an unaccompanied Minor with a 1h40 stop over in Paris. The departure from Dublin was delayed by 1 hour. The agents Mustafa and Laura at the check in counter went out of their way to arrange a new flight with KLM arriving half an hour earlier than the original flight. They were extremely helpful and understanding. We were very impressed with their professional approach and excellent customer service.,,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Dublin to Singapore,March 2025,,,,5.0,,,5,yes
2,Air India,3,“it was not a pleasant experience”,26th March 2025,False," Recently travelled on Air India flight from Toronto to New Delhi. Trust me, any state transport operated buses are so much better as compared to Air India. Flight of around 14 hours with kids and there was no inflight entertainment. It was just not working for almost everyone on the flight. The seats were very uncomfortable. The trays were broken and literally put together using tapes at some places. The overhead reading lights were broken as well and had sharp edges which could easily cut fingers while trying to adjust them. The food quantity was very less it almost seemed like sample food for tasting and there was no variety. The airhostess was polite but inflight service was not good. Didn’t serve tea or coffee and just left the aisle in a hurry. Cold beverages were at room temperature. Flight hit turbulence way too many times. Overall it was not a pleasant experience and would definitely avoid it next time.",,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Toronto to New Delhi,March 2025,1.0,3.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
3,Air India Express,1,"""not accountable for any damage""",23rd March 2025,True,"   No proper communication and very casual approach. Firstly the luggage bag went missing and upon receiving back it was damaged and torn and the contents of the bag were exposed. It was evident that the damage was due to mishandling. They refused to escalate the complaint and provide with a complaint number. Further when it was emailed, they said they are not accountable for any damage to luggage bag.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG-20250323-WA0005-500x500.jpg,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Cochin to Delhi,March 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no

We were told either to get refund or go to hotel ,when I asked about connecting flight from KL I was told that I will depart tomorrow with them I have to stay 2 days in KL for connecting flight to Perth.

I was issued a new ticket that required me to be stranded in Phoenix Arizona for 11 hours. I was originally supposed to arrive at my destination (Minneapolis) at 2:14 pm. My 6 hour trip turned into an all day event. Also, I just got word that my flight to Phoenix is, once again, delayed.

7,Batik Air,1,"""frustrating and disappointing"" ",27th March 2025,True,"   Terrible experience with Batik Air – never again. I was charged for a ticket, but when I arrived at the airport, they couldn’t find my booking in the system. I had no choice but to purchase another ticket just to make it on time. The airport staff were completely unhelpful and told me to email customer service instead. I did – and waited over a month for a response, only to be told to call the service centre. When I called, they told me to email again. Seriously? I’ve been pushed back and forth with no proper support or accountability. The call centre staff were rude and offered zero assistance. This whole experience has been frustrating and disappointing. Never flying Batik Air again.

8,Breeze Airways,2,"""horrible customer service""",24th March 2025,True,"   Breeze has horrible customer service. I contacted them to cancel a reservation for someone in my party. The only way to contact them is via text. The customer service rep told me they would separate out the fare and give me partial credit. Come to find out, they never canceled the fare and when I contacted them again they told me I forfeited the fare. When I sent them the previous texts showing them why I was confused they did not offer any way for me to escalate the concern.

9,Cebu Pacific,1,"""suitcases had been left behind""",23rd March 2025,True,"   Our flight from Coron to Manila, originally scheduled for 11:20 AM, was delayed to 1:50 PM with no explanation. The airport was in total disarray: no information on the screens, no staff in sight, no Wi-Fi. When we finally boarded, we saw that luggage from the previous flight was still being offloaded, and the cabin was visibly dirty. After an unusually short flight of just over an hour, we were informed that 42 suitcases had been left behind due to technical issues. But the luggage was offloaded to lighten the aircraft and shorten the flight tim, keeping it under 3 hours, the legal threshold that would have required the airline to compensate passengers. As compensation, we were offered 1,000 Philippine pesos per bag (about €16), an amount that doesn’t even cover the bare essentials for two days without luggage. An insult more than a remedy.

10,Cyprus Airways,10,“wonderful staff”,26th March 2025,False," I am beyond happy with the assistance I received from this airline and staff. I had back pain and an injury before my flight, and walking at the airport was very difficult for me. They immediately provided me with a wheelchair and a wonderful staff member who took care of me all the way until I boarded the plane. The ground staff, the crew, and the entire experience were absolutely perfect. I can’t believe how kind, helpful, and professional everyone was — I feel truly blessed.

11,Discover Airlines,1,"“for the price, definitely not worth it”",22nd March 2025,True," It all started when we checked in our luggage. We arrived at the Discover counter and only saw the Business Class check-in desks. Since we were flying Business, we headed there. A staff member standing in front told us we had to go around the corner to check in. That seemed possible, so we went there, but it turned out to be the Economy check-in. So, we returned and told the staff member that we needed to check in here since we were flying Business. His rude response: “You could have said that.” Well, it’s not our job to inform him—it’s his job to ask what class we’re flying. It didn’t get better from there. The check-in agent seemed completely uninterested and, at the end, simply stated a number while staring at us when we didn’t immediately understand what it meant. We had to figure out for ourselves that he was referring to the gate. The only positive experience was the lounge (which was a Lufthansa lounge, not a Discover one). Then came boarding. After scanning our tickets, we walked toward the aircraft, but the entrance to Business Class was still blocked because they weren’t ready. If they’re not ready, boarding shouldn’t start! There were passengers with mobility issues who had to stand and wait until they finally opened the section. The cabin crew was okay, but the welcome Prosecco was undrinkable. The salmon trout tataki appetizer was absolutely disgusting—it smelled awful. The plane itself was old, and the seats were extremely uncomfortable. If you’re tall or overweight, good luck. Breakfast was fine, but I’m still waiting for my apple juice. The lavatories weren’t great either—not at the level of other airlines. Overall, it was okay, but for the price, definitely not worth it. I can’t recommend it.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_1345-500x500.jpeg,,Family Leisure,Business Class,Frankfurt to Windhoek,March 2025,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no
12,Eastern Airways,2,"""treated passengers with disdain"" ",28th March 2025,False,"  Aircraft interior was decent, comfortable seats, some good legroom in front row seats. Cabin crew definitely needed a bit of polishing in terms of professionalism and customer service. The purser treated the passengers with disdain and loud conversations between cabin crew and the flight deck about non-related work ""banter"" gave a bad impression. Pilots were fairly jarring in cabin announcements blaming various other parties for delays, which also felt unprofessional. Shut the flight deck door if you're going to make phone calls about the location of the tug- the passengers don't need to hear.",,E170,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Southampton,March 2025,4.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,2,no
13,easyJet,1,“Their entire conduct was unnecessary”,25th March 2025,True," I was stopped to check the size of my bag. I have used the same bag time and time again, it was purchased as a cabin bag to be within the size limits and I have measured it myself. I was shocked when the bag didn't fit in the sizing box. I explained that it has always fit before (including on the way out) and asked for someone to use a tape measure on it. My request was ignored and I was threatened that I wouldn't be boarding the plane, so I had to give in and pay. I have taken photos of my bag to show that it is within their given sizes and sent to to their customer service. They have responded to me, ignoring my evidence completely and just reiterated that the bag needs to fit into the holder. There is no mention of the fact that it is actually within size and their sizing box is incorrectly assembled. Also, I am autistic and to be dragged out and threatened that I wouldn't be getting on the plane, in front of all of the other passengers has caused me to have anxiety issues and take medication for it. I wasn't the only person that mentioned how rude the staff member was to them. Their entire conduct was unnecessary. I don't believe that one instance should impact on the reputation of the company, so I went to try to sort it with them first, before leaving a negative review, but it seems like their customer service is just as bad.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Airport-Bag-2-500x500.jpg,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Keflavik to Manchester,March 2025,4.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2,no
14,Egyptair,1,“the seats were old and torn”,27th March 2025,True," Avoid this airline at any cost! Just pay extra and fly literally ANY other airline but not Egyptair. Our flight from Dar es Salaam to Cairo has to be the MOST annoying flight ever. The check in process was a nightmare. The aircraft was old like it seemed like it was from the 90's. No in flight entertainment system (it was a 6 Hour flight), the seats were old and torn, the tray was broken, the food was pathetic with the eggs smelling really bad and the aircraft was not cleaned (there were wrappers and used tissues in the seat pocket.

15,Egyptair,1,“they made no effort to help”,26th March 2025,False," Avoid EgyptAir – A Disappointing Experience. I had a terrible experience with EgyptAir, and I’m sharing this so others are informed and, hopefully, the airline improves its service. My journey was from Mumbai to Dublin with a layover in Cairo. Here’s how it went: First Flight (Mumbai to Cairo – 6 h30 mins) Pros: The food was good. Cons: No cushions, no blankets, and no earphones for the in-flight entertainment. It was a long, uncomfortable, and boring flight. The cleanliness was also subpar. Layover: 2 hrs 30 mins Second Flight (Cairo to Dublin – 6 hrs 0 mins) Pros: The flight was cleaner than the first. Cons: No blankets, no cushions, and no in-flight service for the first 4 hours—strange and unprofessional! Worse, they did not serve me food. I had attempted online check-in twice to order vegetarian meals, but the system said check-in was only available at the desk. Onboard, when I requested a vegetarian meal, they simply denied my request, stating there was no special order. Even after explaining my situation, they made no effort to help or offer alternatives. The staff didn’t even know the ingredients of what they were serving except beef. I was left starving for the entire flight and felt completely ignored and unwelcome. Adding to the discomfort, the lack of blankets or cushions resulted in severe body pain. Other Disappointments: Unlike airlines such as Virgin Atlantic, British Airways, Etihad, or Swiss Air, the pilots here did not share any information about notable landmarks during the journey. Even after getting a window seat, I did not get a glimpse of the pyramids—a small touch that could have made the experience better. The first half of my journey lacked proper entertainment, and the second half left me hungry. Final Thoughts This is my personal experience and opinion, but I strongly advise choosing a better airline except visiting Egypt itself. A Cairo layover with EgyptAir is not worth it, no matter the extra baggage allowance (few extra Kilos) or a discounted price. You would be left with severe body pain and illness. All the best with your travels!",,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Mumbai to Dublin via Egypt,March 2025,1.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2.0,2,no
16,Emirates,1,“The most unprofessional staff”,25th March 2025,True," The most unprofessional staff I’ve ever seen. Had to use Emirates as backup because Cathay Pacific delayed our flight. Maybe because of that seat selection was not available for us. That one I do not blame this airline on. But: We got two seats way back at the end of 777. Behind me was a man in his 50s. At the altitude I reclined my seat (not all the way back) and was prepared to get some sleep in this 6 hr flight. Immidiately I feel tap on my shoulder and some arguing that I have to raise my seat. He was arguing that he could not eat with my seat reclined. I tried to explain that my seat does not affect his table position, but really I feel like he just wanted more space. He was really unpleasant to talk to, it felt like there was only his needs and everyone around should just obey to that. English is not my native languge, so I finished the argument with ""ask the flight attendant"", I was sure that she can explain everything better than me. The man catches flight attendant, explains that he want me to raise my seat. She does not ask any questions, just stands up near me and commands ""raise your seat"" and proceeds with taking back of my seat and tries to raise it with force. No questions asked. With flight attendant fully on his side I even did not even try to argue. It felt really dengerous to even talk back to these people. Food was given 2 hours (!) after take off. After food serving nobody did not even try to provide us with any sort of bevereges. Again, that is on 6 hrs flight. Is that even legal? We had to catch flight attendant to ask for any water-like substance. How dare you to ask me about upgrades to premium economy or business if you fail to provide any basic service for economy? Or does Emirates starts to provide basic service starting from business? It is logical to just use better airlines instead. It is a level lower than any low-cost airline in the Eastern Europe. I am a frequent flyer and did not expect something like that at the price that I paid. It is by far my worst flight expirience. My family and friends will never use Emirates ever again.",,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Phuket to Dubai,March 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,1.0,1,no
17,Ethiopian Airlines,3,"""seats were in a standard row""",28th March 2025,True,"   Flight ET718 from Addis Ababa to Gatwick on 27th March. We had booked and paid £100 for extra legroom seats which was confirmed on our ticket. Checked in and got boarding pass with same seat numbers. However, on boarding, discovered the seats were in a standard row. It appears our earlier booking used a seat plan for Boeing 787-8 (exit row 28) whereas Ethiopian airlines switched aircraft to Boeing 787-9 (exit row 30). Surely when the boarding passes were printed the booking system should reallocate us to our requested legroom seats. What a shambles. Two other passengers on our flight also got bumped into standard seats. We have also had previous problems using the Ethiopian airlines website (paid twice for same seat reservation). Seems their IT System is flakey and unreliable.

18,Ethiopian Airlines,1,"""a complete disaster""",22nd March 2025,False,"  Our flight from Addis Ababa to Frankfurt on January 20 was a complete disaster. When we got to our seats, a woman with a child was sitting in one of them and refused to move. She claimed the flight attendants told her she could take the seat for her child. Instead of resolving the issue, the crew did nothing, and we had to argue, wave our boarding passes in their faces, and fight for the seats we had paid for.

19,Etihad Airways,3,"""A very disengaged attitude""",26th March 2025,False,"  Return to BKK - Business Class flights both on time. Ground crew have the customer care skills second to a Military sergeant, rude, disengaged and flippant. Seats requested were honored. Plane was clean and was quite smooth. Food below expectations, menus are now clearly on the cost cutting plan. Soup / Chicken thighs and ice cream or cheese. Wines like others have mentioned are low quality. Champagne is worth avoiding and not palatable. Last but not least the cabin Crew obviously do the very basics are not proactive and had to be called each time. Too busy sitting and chatting in the galley than ensuring any passenger may want something. A very disengaged attitude and lacked any polish or personal engagement skills.

20,Fiji Airways,8,"""attentiveness and kindness of the crew""",28th March 2025,True,"   Returning from my honeymoon to Mexico, we flew via Qantas business on the way there and now our return trip is with Fiji Airways. We have just finished the first leg and I’m writing this while enjoying the Nadi business class lounge. The flight was amazing. I had my reservations because I’m aware Fiji airways doesn’t provide pyjamas and their menu and offerings are a little more restrictive than that of Qantas, but I felt compelled to write a review because of just how great Fiji Airways were. The cabin crew were the most attentive I have ever experienced and they memorize everyone’s names. Even when you’re not in your seat, walking to get a snack or to go to the bathroom they were calling me by name asking me how my flight is and if I want a snack. Comparatively, on my Qantas business class flight, the cabin crew don’t speak to you unless they have to. The seats were comfortable and felt nice and private. When I went to make my bed, crew ran to me to do it for me. The pillow is nice and full, they give you a mattress cover for your seat and a nice full doona as well as a blanket. They served Mumm on board as the champagne which is a personal fav so that gets extra marks. The food was not as good as Qantas. But it was not bad. I enjoyed the pumpkin and ginger soup a lot. Was probably the highlight of the meal. As my main I opted for the Fijian bbq chicken. The potato rostis were a little mealie, the chicken was flavorful although a little tough. The passionfruit mousse was alright but nothing to ring home about. The fruit plate had a nice selection of grapes, blackberries, raspberries, pineapple, rockmelon and honeydew. I also opted for the standard brekky which consisted of an omelette, tomato, a chicken sausage. I’m not a breakfast person but it was ok. Another comparison to Qantas - no barista style coffee on board. So I had to settle for an American style coffee which I’m not a big fan of. The entertainment system is really functional but needs a bigger selection of new movies. Wasn’t a whole lot on there that I was too keen to watch, but I made do. Overall, the flight was really comfortable and I would definitely fly and recommend Fiji Airways. The attentiveness and kindness of the crew really made the flight.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_7390-500x500.jpeg,A350,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Los Angeles to Nadi,March 2025,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,5,yes

24,French Bee,1,“What a colossal mistake!”,22nd March 2025,True," We recently flew French Bee from Miami to Paris Orly, lured by the promise of lower fares compared to our usual airline. What a colossal mistake! First, their website is painfully slow and not user-friendly—just booking tickets felt like a chore. At Miami Airport, check-in was disorganized and stressful. We brought an extra checked bag, knowing there’d be a fee, but were shocked when we were charged a whopping $140 for it! Once on board, we were stunned by the narrowest seats we've ever experienced on an international flight—truly uncomfortable, with hard bottoms and barely any room. And we are not large people. Anyone taller or broader than average, beware. The cabin crew were unfriendly and dismissive. Food options were terrible, portions ridiculously small, and everything else—from a coffee to a blanket—came with extra fees. Want a basic cup of coffee? That’ll be €2.50. Unreal. On our return flight, things went from bad to outrageous. We had the exact same carry-ons we flew out with—1 rolling bag, 1 backpack, 1 tote handbag between the two of us, all within the airline's published limits. But at boarding, we and 8 other passengers were stopped, scolded, and told we’d have to pay $240 or we wouldn’t be allowed on the plane. When we tried to explain we were within limits, the gate staff became aggressive—my husband was pushed by one of them and told, ""Pay now or you don't fly."" It was blatant extortion, and all of us were furious and shocked. In the end, we were forced to pay under pressure just to get home. Once back on board, the same cramped seats and bad service greeted us again. We’ve never felt so mistreated by an airline. The bullying, hidden fees, and lack of professionalism make French Bee a complete disgrace. We will never fly with them again, and we strongly urge others to stay far away. If saving a few bucks means being treated like cargo, it’s just not worth it.",,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Miami to Paris ,March 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1,no
25,Frontier Airlines,1,“Choose anyone but Frontier”,24th March 2025,True," It's been many, many years since I've been encouraged enough to write a bad review for anything (maybe a decade?). So for me to take the time to sit down & actually put this out there is something. This was our first/only & last time flying with Frontier. We fly 6-10 round trip flights per year & are somewhat savvy travelers. Upon checking in, the employee told us we could save $25 if we download the app & do it on our phones, vs going to the desk or using the computer. So we did. I had an option to select one bag 41-50 lbs, and one check in bag. I selected one of each (and my wife's eyes verified indeed I selected those). $75/ea, checked out & paid $150. Checked my bag & headed to the gate. While in the line to board a few people from the ticket scanner, the employee behind the desk came over & randomly asked to see our tickets. She reviewed them & said we never paid for the carry on. We both insisted we did, downstairs through the app. She pulled up our reservation & said we paid for one ""oversized' bag & no carry on & we owe an additional $100 or we can't board the flight. She was extremely dismissive, condescending & abrupt with us. We protested quite firmly, insisting we selected everything on the app, I showed her my credit card receipt & said I don't have an oversized bag. She said since she can't verify it if it's my mistake I still need to pay $100 more. We got into a back & forth, not happy to be taken advantage of like this. She said it's not her problem & if we don't pay her we can just stay in Tampa. Unbelievably disgusting attitude & customer service. They called over their supervisor to try & resolve it. I explained we used the app, I selected the carry on & we don't understand how this breakdown could even happen. I said my bag was 48 lbs which can't be overweight & he said there's the problem - we recently changed it to now anything over 40 is overweight & an additional $75, I was about to let you through until you told me that (every flight I've ever been on is 50+). When I selected it in the app none of this was clear, it did not say I was paying $75 for the bag & $75 extra for those 8 pounds (in which I would've just moved 1 thing into my carry on & dissolved that issue). We ended up paying $250 to bring 1 suitcase & 1 carry on! Our flights were $118 each so the luggage more than doubled our flight cost. This system is a total sham, I gave up & paid the $100 extra. Two employees not directly involved (as at this point there were now 5 employees here watching) came into & told us in the Jetway they felt bad & don't agree with how this system works but it's out of their hands. They came onto the plane & allowed my wife & I (who were separated) to seat together & said hopefully that makes us feel somewhat better. I did some research to discover that the employees at the terminal receive a commission (it's $3-$5 each) for every person they can find boarding to make pay extra for a carry on. A guy in front of us in the jetway told him they made him pay $100 to bring his playstation onto the plane! This whole system is fraudulent, from the unclear app to the extraneous fees.

26,Frontier Airlines,1,“Their policies are inhuman”,23rd March 2025,True," I had a horrible experience in the Orlando airport and was never given a boarding pass via the website, once I checked in online. I looked all over the site to find where to get my boarding pass, and found nothing. My dad looked also and found nothing. I hoped I would get it emailed to me, but didn't get that either. When I went to drop off my bags, I was told I had to pay $25/person ($50 total) to have our boarding passes printed. This is outrageous since I was not able to get it on my own. Once at the gate, after paying hundreds of dollars in up-charges for a checked bag, I was stopped at the gate and told I had to pay another $99 for my backpack that fit under my seat, because it didn't fit in the ridiculous ""under seat space"" reference frame outside the plane. It is obvious that all this company does is find ways to weasel out more money from people. I did NOT need to use the overhead compartment for my bag because it DID fit under the seat, because their reference is HALF the size of what is actually under the seat. The whole point of a ""carry on"" bag is that it takes overhead space, which mine did not. Their policies are inhuman and I will never fly Frontier again. I also found out from other passengers that this flight was giving away FREE carry-on bag allowances for many of the passengers!",,A320,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Denver,March 2025,1.0,3.0,,1.0,,,1,no
27,Frontier Airlines,1,"""the worst airline ever""",22nd March 2025,False,"  Frontier is the worst airline ever. 6 years ago I said I would never fly with them again and ended up having no choice this past week. We flew from Slc to LAX for a cruise and then back to Slc. We paid an upgrade for the 6 of us to sit together on both flights. We had 3 adults, 1 minor, one infant, and my son with Down syndrome. 2 of us were able to sit together each way. I’ve never seen an airline work so hard to keep group of travelers from being together. They care more about the animals pictured on the tail than the people flying. The price to check a bag or have a carry-on is ridiculous. One of my checked bags was damaged on the first flight then about completely destroyed on the second. With what I paid for checked bags and seats that were supposed to be together I could’ve had 6 first class seats on Delta. It was so horrible I wish I would’ve cancelled the cruise and lost all that money and not given frontier extra money for a bunch of lies. Never again Frontier.

28,Jeju Air,1,"""Avoid this airline at all cost"" ",28th March 2025,True,   This is hands down the worst airline I have ever come across as far as customer service is concerned. They have zero effort in helping a foreign customer. Yes. The flights are cheap but there it stops. Flight to Japan was ok but the seat I had purchased was completely inadequate. Have never sat on such a tight and uncomfortable seat. Fortunately the flight is short - only just over 2 hours. It is the situation with the return flight which is giving most concern. All week I tried to purchase extra luggage so can take my shopping back (their so called Biz ticket which allows more weight is not available it appears for any dates). The “FlyBag” fare only allows 15kg. Trying to add more turned out to be impossible. The payment is declined every time! I tried over several days. I contacted the card issuer and they said no problem at their end. It is the airline doing this. The customer service emails reply the same response constantly and not giving any real solution. Some email replies come in Korean. The chat is hopeless. They just leave the chat when you get to a certain point. So finally (after 4 days of trying) reached the 24 hour booking time limit after which you can’t add luggage. Now you will face charges at the airport which will be several times the cost of the fare! There seems complete unwillingness to offer any real customer support and one suspects it is designed so that the customer ends up having to pay the extraordinarily expensive charges. I travel to Japan once a year and Shizuoka airport was an attractive idea as it is small and thus customs etc are a breeze. But never again with this airline. I have flown low cost before but this is the first airline you feel is out to rip you off completely. Avoid this airline at all cost.,https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_9471-500x500.jpeg,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Incheon to Shizuoka,March 2025,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1,no

30,Qantas Airways,4,"""product is currently an insult"" ",27th March 2025,True,"   The decline in Qantas quality of the last 10 years has been staggering. My review is based on a return business class trip from Auckland to Paris on a 787 aircraft. The comments on catering apply to every  leg. No one is fooled by a green salad consisiting of a few leaves of lettuce with some olive oil dumped on top. Accompanying bread was stale. Prawns had the texture of old rope. Main courses consisted of rice or quinoa with meat on top. Dessert is basically non existent, unless you count a tub of ice cream or convenience store quality cheese. Presentation is sloppy also, on battered grey trays. And I didn't know undrinkable Australian red wines even existed - but Qantas seems to have sourced them. Seat quality, particularly for a relatively new product, is also poor. The seat isn't comfortable in any configuration but is particularly bad in bed mode - the padding is rock hard to the point where it causes pain quickly if you stay in one position for any period of time. The provided added thin ""mattress"" (which is just a blanket) provides no extra comfort. The pods are pitched so tightly togther it can be very difficult to exit and enter the seat, particularly in bed mode. The eco-themed amenity kit seemed to be nothing but a zippered bag full of brown paper.

32,Qatar Airways,2,“still not heard from them for 5 weeks”,27th March 2025,False," My flight from Perth to Heathrow was cancelled at the last minute whilst we were in the departure lounge at midnight. The flight was on July 13th 2024 from Perth Western Australia, due to land at Heathrow Airport London on Sunday afternoon 14th July. Eventually I arrived at Heathrow on Tuesday 16th July at 06:00. I was told that all additional expenses would be refunded. Well, seven months later I am still trying to get a refund. They eventually offered me $250.00 voucher that could only be used with Qatar Airways valid for one year. I declined this offer as the two-night accommodation with meals in Perth city center and vouchers for taxis that I declined as my son was prepared to drive an hour to pick me up at 02:00 in the morning would have cost far more than the voucher they were offering. I was £108.00 out of pocket for my pre-purchased train tickets booked for Sunday 14th and I lost two days of work. Whilst waiting for information on when my newly arranged flight would be leaving, they could not even be bothered to contact me. After an abortive trip to the airport after we found online my boarding pass which had been changed telling me my flight was now at 03:30 Monday morning and a call to Qatar Airlines who told me they did not know, arrived at airport to find out that there was no flight. Their response was oh your contact details is a UK mobile number! As if that made any difference in these circumstances. Eventually after giving the Qatar helpdesk my sons contact details; they informed me they had found a flight from Perth to Doha then to Athens and then finally Heathrow. Then another which was Perth to Doha to Milan to Heathrow. On arrival they told me they had a flight from Perth to Doha and then onto Heathrow. This had a six-hour stopover in Doha. Eventually I arrived home after a nightmare journey at 06:00 on Tuesday morning during rush hour in London. Just the two days late. Despite constant contact with Qatar customer services they just kept telling me that this was their policy and that was the end of the issue. When you do get through you spend another hour telling them that they have all the details. But no, they want to go through it all again. I still have not heard from them for five weeks.",,Boeing 777 ,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Perth to London Heathrow via Doha,July 2024,1.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,,3,no
33,Royal Air Maroc,9,“A great experience with RAM”,26th March 2025,True," Well. This was my 1st time with RAM. They are more expensive than other airlines because they are protected by their Government. Although carry on bags are checked by scanners before passport control, they're checked again by the staff at the departure gate. It was a bit of a faff, but the queue at the gate moved reasonably quickly. The staff there were polite and good humoured. It must be tedious doing the same thing over and over again. Got a transfer bus to the plane and fairly quick boarding. Again friendly and polite staff on the plane. Was given a towelette to freshen up. I'd booked seat 8c at the front of the economy, and there was no-one in 8a or 8b, so I had room to spread out. The plane seemed very clean. Take off was pretty much on time. There were clear instructions from the crew on safety procedures, flight direction and flight time. After about 30 minutes, TV screens were lowered from the ceiling, and these showed a live map with location, speed and eta. I wish other airlines would follow this. About 45 minutes into the flight, cabin crew came round with juice/water, followed quickly with a hot meal (chicken or fish with potatoes, carrots and peas and a spicy sauce, a roll with cream cheese and a pastry. It wasn't gourmet dining but it was adequate and tasty. I've had a lot worse! The cabin crew then came round with tea or coffee, followed by the duty free cart. I'd already bought my allowance of cigarettes at Casa airport, but I was annoyed when I found out that prices on the plane were about 15% lower!!! All of this helped to pass the time, and now over north west France with just over an hour to landing, I read my book for a while and relaxed. We landed at Manchester 15 minutes EARLY.

35,Scoot,1,“pretty atrocious service standards”,23rd March 2025,True," Booked flight TR608 for 15 March 2025, flying from Singapore to Bangkok. Indicated plane type in original booking was A320. Paid extra for Exit Row seats 12D and 12E. Only realised when I entered the plane, that the plane type had been changed from an A320 to B787. Due to the change in plane type, my seats which were still 12D and 12E as indicated on the Boarding Passes, were now no longer Exit Row seat for which I had paid extra, but standard seats. This was due to the differing seat configuration between the 2 type of planes. There was no prior notification of the change in plane type, exit row seats no longer being available on the new plane or how the additional paid amount for the Exit Row seats would be refunded, either via email or even during check-in which was done personally at check-in counter attended by a service staff. I will now have to take my own initiative to contact Scoot to apply for a refund. If i don't, i will not get any refund. This is pretty atrocious service standards. It does not cost very much more to have a better passenger management system which will automatically alert the customers of the changes and offer a refund automatically.",,Boeing 787,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Bangkok ,March 2025,3.0,3.0,,3.0,,,2,no
36,Spirit Airlines,1,"""We never got the refund""",25th March 2025,True,"   My pregnant wife, me and my 20 month old daughter try to fly from Orlando to Bogota. We arrived at the Airport on time and went to the self check in counter. There we could not check in because of my daughter. So we got redirected to the counter where we waited in line. We were second in line before they stopped the line to check in people for different flights with a last call (Costa Rica). We still had enough time so we waited. Once we got to the counter, they told us it is too late and we won't be able to fly. According to the Supervisor we did not reacted to the last call for Bogota, which never was announced. My parents in law stood with us in line and also never heard a last call for Bogota. We told them we heard Costa Rica but never Bogota. Their answer was that if we heard Costa Rica, the call for Bogota was much earlier. Weird because we heard Costa Rica and still had 50min until boarding. Spirit policy is that they make the last call 40 min prior to boarding. So they must have made their last call way to early and not at the correct time. They rebooked us for a flight the next day. But we wanted to fly out that day because we already drove 2 hours to the airport and have people waiting for us in Bogota. So we asked if we can get a full refund if we look for other airlines to fly out that day. The supervisor confirmed the refund. So we booked a different airline and canceled the rebooked flight for Spirit for the next day. They never wanted to give me a printed confirmation of that cancelation. They said I have to trust their word. We never got the refund and they say we were a No Show. ",,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Orlando to Bogota,January 2025,2.0,,,1.0,,,1,no

When I arrived at the check-in, the counter was closed and I was denied check-in. I tried to contact staff but to no avail. I raised a complaint but they insist that the counter was open, while their team in DXB is saying it closes 80 minutes before. Their team in DXB is not willing to give written confirmation of that, so I am stuck in a limbo of lack of responsibility by Sri Lankan airlines. Also, they are not refunding anything. I believe this tells a lot about the quality of the airline, if they cannot even be honest when making a mistake. I informed their management but they are not interested.

43,Turkish Airlines,1,"""Keeping the cabin in total darkness""",24th March 2025,True,"   I paid €68 to select two window seats on a daytime Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to Taipei, expecting to enjoy the view. However, on Turkish Airlines' new aircraft, the windows no longer have manual blinds—instead, they use an electronic dimming system that can be centrally controlled by the crew. On both the outbound and return flights (Istanbul–Taipei–Istanbul), the crew kept the windows fully dimmed the entire flight, despite multiple requests to adjust them even slightly. Their response? “Company policy.” One of the most frustrating parts was flying over China, where the high mountains were covered in snow—an absolutely spectacular view. But the only way to see it was through the bottom camera on the entertainment system, which is available from any seat. This is no substitute for a real view through an actual window. If this is their policy, why do they charge extra for window seats? This is misleading and unfair. Keeping the cabin in total darkness for daytime flights forces passengers into an unnatural sleep cycle. Many people, including myself, arrived at our destinations in the evening, unable to sleep at night and severely jetlagged. It makes you wonder—is this about passenger comfort, or just making the crew’s job easier by keeping people asleep? I reached out to customer service, expecting an explanation or resolution, but all I received were generic, copy-paste responses that ignored my concerns. Their final message made it clear that they would not take my complaint further, essentially telling me to give up and stop writing. It’s obvious that Turkish Airlines does not care about passenger experience.
