0,0,AB Aviation,9,"""pretty decent airline""",11th November 2019,True,"  Moroni to Moheli. Turned out to be a pretty decent airline. Online booking worked well, checkin and boarding was fine and the plane looked well maintained. Its a very short flight - just 20 minutes or so so i didn't expect much but they still managed to hand our a bottle of water and some biscuits which i though was very nice.

13,13,Adria Airways,2,"""Would not fly again""",30th June 2018,True,"  Ljubljana to Munich. Adria's checkin system is obviously barely coping. It wasn't possible to obtain an electronic boarding pass (iphone wallet version) from Adria's site. The option was there but it failed without any further explanation. Further more I was not able to checkin to return flight online - neither through Adria nor Lufthansa web site. In the end I made it via Lufthansa mobile app. Go figure. Both issues were reported to customer care and both were ignored. I experienced the same customer care ""policy"" couple of years ago when my inquiry with customer support was basically ignored. Flight was actually operated by a Romanian company Carpatair. The cabin was outdated and dirty with a funny smell lingering around. The latter stuck to my clothes for the day - not that great if you are meeting a client. Cabin crew was also quite disorganised and mixed up orders of all passengers sitting around me. Would not fly again.

108,108,Aegean Airlines,5,“claims to be pet-friendly”,27th October 2024,True," While my journey with Aegean Airlines started pleasantly, the arrival experience at Athens Eleftherios Venizelos was highly disappointing, especially regarding handling my pets. The check-in crew at London Heathrow was friendly and helpful, but this positive experience was overshadowed by what happened upon arrival in Athens. Aegean Airlines promotes itself as pet-friendly, but my experience showed otherwise. Traveling alone with three small dogs in separate kennels, I expected clear guidance or assistance from the airline, especially since they knew I was a single passenger. Unfortunately, no instructions were given, and no representatives offered help. After a delayed luggage pickup, I was left to search for where my dogs might be. After asking an airport cleaner for help (because no one else was around, like airport representatives), I eventually located my dogs’ crates abandoned on the floor in a different section of the baggage area—an upsetting and unacceptable situation. To make matters worse, an airport staff member nearby was on her phone and didn’t care to assist or greet me. There was also no help handling the kennels on a trolley, making it incredibly difficult for pets to navigate and find transport out of the airport. For an airline that claims to be pet-friendly, this experience was far from it—terrible customer service from Aegean Airlines on the ground in Athens. I hope Aegean Airlines seriously reconsiders how it supports passengers traveling with their beloved pets to ensure smoother and safer experiences in the future.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_5873-500x500.jpeg,A320,Business,Business Class,"London Heathrow to Athens, Eleftherios Venizelos",October 2024,2.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,,1.0,1.0,no,negative,0.8028807640075684,5.040598392486572,jeep
109,109,Aegean Airlines,9,“Great value for money!”,13th October 2024,True," Upgraded to business with Plusgrade. Great value for money! Still one of the very few full service carriers with a classic service offering a welcome dring before departure and a full (hot) meal with option to choose from for the main menu. It's the small details that count with Aegean such as the cloth serviette (haven't seen this for quite some time on any medium haul with any airline) or the possibility to order a tasty Cappucino or Espresso. Additionally, typically new aircraft are used between FRA/MUC and Athens (A 320 neo/ A 321 neo) which adds to the overall excellent experience. Unfortunately, I had a short layover in Athens on my way to Paros and as the flight from Frankfurt was slightly delayed, I couldn't catch my flight to Paros. Outstanding incident handling by Aegean Airlines - they rebooked me on the first available flight next morning and sent me an SMS with a reservation confirmation at Athens Sofitel Airport hotel where complementary dinner and breakfast was offered. I had many incidents with another European Airline this year but never had such a smooth incident handling process like this. Many thanks, Aegean - you continue to be my first choice on the way to Greece!",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/20241008_FRA-ATH-A3831_espresso-500x500.jpg,A321neo,Business,Business Class,Frankfurt to Paros via Athens,October 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,yes,positive,0.9517609477043152,7.355823993682861,espresso

Our Air Tags told us that our bags were still in Athens. I filed a claim at the AVI Partners counter and they gave me confidence that they knew that our bags would be delivered by 1:30 the next day. In the morning our air tags told me that they had been flown early in the day to Madrid and then later to Barcelona. At 1:00 I tried to call then number on the claim and it said (in Spanish) that it was an unmonitored number despite it was on the form to call for updates. I got in a taxi and went to the airport and found the AVI Partners was about to close at 3:00 pm. I caught the lady she did not speak English, but I showed her my phone and the status and the paper, I kept pointing to the phone and finally we got someone that spoke English. These people had no clue about the status of my bags. The English-speaking person at the Iberia counter took pity on me and looked at my air tags status and then with the use of her computer, found the bags in a storage locker  in the airport. Finally, after a walk through the airport and waiting 20 minutes emerged our 4 lost bags. The best part, was after I spent the time at the airport, and I paid for a taxi and got back to the hotel, I got an email from Aegean Airlines that my bags were being forwarded to my hotel. •Why did Aegean airlines not know my bags were in the airport?

154,154,Aegean Airlines,1,"""out of my last 20 flights only one was on time""",25th September 2023,True," I am gold on Aegean for the last ten years or so. I avoid flying this airline as much as possible. I can certify that out of my last 20 flights with this airline over the last two years, only one was on time. The airline has cut deep in operations and has contracted the worst ground services around their destinations. It shows every day in their inability to execute a flight schedule that is unrealistic at best. This current flight is leaving an hour late for no reason. The plane came to Athens on time from a previous destination - I checked. At Athens, they were unable to turn it around on time and picked an extra hour. Again, operations and a poor schedule. Boarding at Venice was a zoo. All classes mixed. Held in a very hot bus for a long time before rushing to the plane. The plane - a 16 years old 320 with ragged seats and completely filthy from previous flight. Total disgrace and what happens when ground services are low quality. Once landed, naturally the same bus experience again. Priority luggage comes out last. Avoid Aegean. There's an alternative for almost every destination. They are a third world airline.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/16956630467416937441037722578767-500x500.jpg,A320,Business,Business Class,Venice to Athens,September 2023,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,negative,0.9010311365127563,5.517897129058838,ambulance

Acceptable on the return night flight for one drink service as it night time but during the day? I asked for two mini cans of coke and kept one for the meal. The meal was inedible and the starter disgusting. This was accompanied by tea of coffee. Then that was it, just a nice mini tub of ice cream. Then crew vanished into thin air. The galley at the back was completely empty and unattended. Then just before landing a warm filled roll (cheese and tomato).

296,296,Aero VIP,8,"""fun and unique retro-experience""",17th July 2017,False,"  Funchal to Porto Santo. This 10-minutes flight is a true experience. Aero Vip carries out the public service obligation connection between Funchal and the smaller Porto Santo airport located on the island with the same name. The outbound flight was on a vintage (1989) Jetstream 32 turboprop airliner with the return flight being on a slightly older (1987) Jetstream 31. In both cases the safety briefing was carried out by the first officer himself, as the plane does not have any FA on board. The outbound flight left right on time and touched down in PXO just 10/15 minutes later. The plane on the way back arrived late and we left PXO with some 30 minutes of delay, again reaching our destination in slight over 10 minutes. The planes’ interiors are quite worn out but overall the planes gave me the impression of being in a good mechanical shape. If you take this flight to reach the beaches in Porto Santo, as was my case, the whole flight is a really fun and unique retro-experience for aviation enthusiasts which unfortunately comes with a hefty price tag (150 EUR return). It needs to be said however, that the rates are much cheaper for residents who need this flight as a means to ensure territorial continuity.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/IMG_6709-500x500.jpg,BAe Jetstream,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Funchal to Porto Santo,July 2017,4.0,2.0,,3.0,,,3.0,yes,positive,0.5560016632080078,5.974308490753174,wing
308,308,Aeroflot Russian Airlines,5,"""felt very rushed and unpolished""",30th January 2022,True,"  Aeroflot has set high standards of achieving a 5-star airline status and my expectations significantly increased as a result. Positives included a seamless upgrade from Comfort to Business at LHR, good Plaza Premium lounge, very good miles earning vs redeeming ratio. The A350 hard product is phenomenal, especially on a short London route, and the catering on this flight exceeded the expectations (usually poor hot meal, however, the 4 cheese pappardelle was very good). However, there are two drawbacks on Aeroflot. Firstly, I  dislike Aeroflot’s or SVO’s standard practice of parking planes at the literally remotest ramps possible in -6C and with ice covering the stairs. I understand there maybe logistics issues, but doing so to a premium-heavy flight like London and for their most luxurious widebody is just beyond logic. I am observing that the crew service on the A350 / B777 is poorer than on their other planes. It gave me a feeling that the crew were very much undertrained; as a result the service, although efficient, felt very rushed and unpolished.  I still believe that the Aeroflot Business Class is above any of its European counterparts from the overall package size view, and if one manages to upgrade for miles (amazing redemption value) like I often do, then this product is possibly the best business class. However, full-fare paying passengers might be disappointed, because, in addition to a cutting-edge hard product, for such money, you expect a hospitable and personalised staff service beyond the ‘just tick’ attitude.  Overall, is Aeroflot a good airline, yes. Is Aeroflot a 5-star level airline and is its business class worth paying a full fare, no.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/86D31E16-0930-42E1-865D-E9C0AD649224-500x500.jpeg,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,London to Moscow,January 2022,5.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,5.0,3.0,2.0,no,positive,0.9299851059913636,5.496666431427002,beer glass

I told her we were flying Premium and I was also a Skyteam Elite Plus member (free additional suitcases) and the suitcase was only 21kg. On international flights 23kg is allowed (according to the homepage and ticket). She said that she would make an exception. We have access to the lounge and through my Elite Plus status with Skyteam either way. Only the lounge is in the terminal between arrival and departure. So it's outside. Complete nonsense, because a lounge belongs after security and passport control, because you never know how long you have and can't leave the lounge 10 minutes before boarding like everywhere else. They really don't serve wine in business class. Argentina, a wine producer? The “food” was a light sandwich wrapped in plastic. They simply moved one of the backpacks in business class to put a suitcase from economy class in the upper compartment. We pay more to have more comfort and peace and quiet.

I was not sure what to expect, because reviews are very mixed. Both stretches were flown on their A340. On the outbound route, the seats were very old/outdated, although reasonably comfortable. The in-flight system was very limited with just 4 movies and not the best. On the inbound flight we had a different plane and the seats looked much better, although overall they were the same type, but the video screens were much larger. There was also a bigger choice in movies. On both flights the cabin crew was very attentive and pleasant. The meals, although quite abundant, were mediocre in taste, and in both cases, something or the other was forgotten (like the dressing). Bread was cold and/or stale. My biggest point of criticism was the check-in. I had a carry-on weighing 12.3 kilos. First at the counter in Bogotá they made a big fuss over size, but this particular TUMI bag does fit maximum accepted standards. They insisted I fit it in the thing to measure it and when they saw for themselves it did meet size requirements, they insisted to weigh it and told me to either take out the 2.3 kilos or have it checked. This when on Copa and Avianca they let me take it in on board in Economy, no questions asked, and this was business! On the inbound flight they had 3 counters in Buenos Aires with SkyPriority signs, but all 3 were unstaffed. The last check-in agent just walked away with leaving passengers in the SkyPriority line without saying anything. When I complained to the girl who did check me in at an economy counter, she said I had arrived just during a schedule change (how weird!). All in all it was a mixed bag with the actual flight a much better experience than the experience on the ground.

I flew from Tangier to Gatwick on 17th February 2023 and found the check-in agent to be friendly and efficient as well as polite and clearly a gifted linguist too! The check-in process was prompt as was the departure. It was reassuring to see that security was taken seriously and several checks took place before boarding. My only gripe was that no provision was made for elderly people, disabled passengers and those with babies to have priority boarding. Some passengers were allowed to take far too much hand luggage while others were strictly controlled. A lack of consistency was apparent. The cabin crew were efficient. Service was based on those who preordered items online. The staff then performed a purchase trolley service. This service was well organised. Full credit to the staff. The seats were comfortable and a route map was used on this A320. Disembarkation was a reasonable affair but the crew were not to be seen to say farewell the passengers and the captain did not make any announcement either.

It can be a delightful experience or it could be a disaster, although I must say that in the last year you can feel some change inside the management and the service is improving and becoming good, therefore I trust them and give them 10 points for the change they are developing. Some might say that paying for the snacks and drinks it is a downside but I do think that for flights shorter then 2h you really don't need all these. The prices they offer are OK and the quality of the products has improved. You still get the chocolate heart when exiting the aircraft. The planes they got after the restructuring are in very good shape. Not mentioning that the flights are almost all the time landing on time or even before schedule. It is still very difficult to use their website in order to buy tickets and this needs improvement. The mobile apps are sometimes too long under maintenance and you cannot use all the features, but at least people are well informed about it.

1090,1090,Air Berlin,7,"""the extra legroom is really valuable to me""",21st November 2016,False," We booked our trip to Phuket on the Air Berlin website. The segments from Abu Dhabi were operated by Etihad Airways and the rest was operated by Air Berlin. Checked in online, but when we arrived at the airport we found out, that our seats from Abu Dhabi to Phuket had been reassigned to other passengers. Reason was, that Air Berlin can not access the Etihad Airways booking system. Hence our boarding passes were invalid and we did not get any window seats any more. Apart from that however, check in procedures were smooth and seamless. Air Berlin offers their XL seats (economy seats with more legroom) for free to their frequent flyers and I have to say, that I love them. They are exactly what I was looking after. I do not need any premium economy product where the food is the same but only presented differently. I get extra baggage allowance and other benefits from my frequent flyer status. So the extra legroom is really valuable to me. Even if I didn't get it for free, I would be more than willing to pay those 79€. The extra space allows you to stretch your legs and to find comfortable and relaxing position for a long haul flight. Boarding was done in an efficient way and we were able to take off on time. Pillows and blankets were distributed in advance, whereas the amenity kits (toothbrush, sleeping mask, ear plugs) were distributed after we were airborne. Shortly after take off the crew distributed a sandwich and announced, that there will be breakfast prior to our arrival in Berlin. By doing so, the crew was able to maximise sleeping time for their passengers. After snack service, water bottles were given to each passengers and the light was switched off.

We managed to make it to our connecting plane Boarding Passes in hand, only to be told we had been removed (our seats undoubtedly re-sold). After much dithering, the staff managed to re assign us. However, our luggage didn’t make the flight as Rouge had decided to put it on a later flight (ours and lots of other peoples) but didn’t think to tell us, so we waited ages at the carousel the other end unnecessarily. Eventually and after much anxiety on our part it all arrived at our hotel in the middle of the night. My husband and I were in Premium Economy. The seats were extremely hard and uncomfortable. Seatbelts were short with not much room to slacken. The legroom was fine, but you couldn’t stretch out as there was a large mounting bracket beneath the seat in front. The overhead bins were minuscule. The iPads we were given to entertain us on the return flight wouldn’t connect properly, saying there was an error. We couldn’t be bothered to report it as we were so tired. It looked like everyone else’s was the same. The food was just ok and nothing special. Air stewards on all flights were friendly enough, but did seem disinterested. My in-laws were in Economy and experienced all of the above, except smaller seats and no in-flight entertainment. Unfortunately, their seats weren’t clean either, attached is a picture of the gap in my mother-in-laws footwell, it was absolutely filthy and there appeared to be months of old litter and food debris. Unfortunately, as a whole Air Canada Rouge was pretty poor and it’s highly unlikely that we will ever use them again, or recommend them to anyone.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/C16FF2CA-F2AA-49F9-902B-015EC9593A19-e1569433734286-500x500.jpeg,,Couple Leisure,Premium Economy,Manchester to Calgary via Toronto,September 2019,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no,neutral,0.570115327835083,4.421811580657959,tape player
1359,1359,Air Canada rouge,1,"""nothing premium about this aircraft or service""",11th September 2019,False,"  Las Vegas to Toronto. There was nothing premium (or Rouge's version of Business Class) about this aircraft or service. First, the aircraft: a very old 767 where the overhead bins were not configured to match today's carry-on baggage. Thankfully, my carry-on was only partially filled because I had to push that down to squeeze it into the bin above my seat. The seat itself looked premium class in a 2 by 2 by 2 configuration. On take-off and landing everything rattled and shook and I was actually surprised the plane made the flight without falling to pieces. Service: only a bottle of water laid on the seat with no pre-flight drink service like other ""business class"" offerings from other airlines. The wine, if one wants to call it that, was barely drinkable and I chose the pasta meal choice because the curry from the butter chicken was making me nauseous and I was in row 1! The crew did the mandatory service of drinks followed by lunch then a snack before landing. However, in between all of this there was hardly any follow-up with the premium class passengers. They were more concerned with ensuring that the curtain from the cabin to the galley was shut solid with the velcro closures. Getting to Vegas I used a different airline where the service was top notch as it should for business class but the kicker: the other airline cost was about 70% less than what I paid for this dreadful flight!",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/20190907_162602-500x500.jpg,Boeing 767-300,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Las Vegas to Toronto,September 2019,4.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,,,1.0,no,negative,0.6885370016098022,5.507844924926758,photocopier

Flight took off and arrived on time. A good dinner was served shortly after take-off and a breakfast shortly before landing. The cabin crew were friendly and professional. However I have to say that I prefer the layout in the business class on their A330. The layout on this newer aircraft certainly has more functions but it looked quite cumbersome and crowded to me. Incredibly the selection of French songs was also very limited. Lounge in Pointe-à-Pitre was also quite small and very limited food ( good if you are on a diet as they were very slow to replenish the food supply ). Overall I think Air Caraïbes is good for this route but a few improvements can be made.,https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/20180418_213803-500x500.jpg,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Pointe-à-Pitre to Paris Orly,April 2018,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,yes,positive,0.8227794170379639,5.97451639175415,plate
1390,1390,Air China,1,"""the most uncomfortable flights""",8th February 2025,True,"   This was one of the most uncomfortable flights I have ever been on. I had initially booked with Cathay Pacific (flight CX6122) from Hong Kong to Chengdu, expecting their usual high standards. However, it turned out to be a joint flight operated by Air China (flight 412), and the experience was disappointing. The plane felt old-fashioned (A320-200), with cramped seats, no in-flight entertainment, no Wi-Fi, and little legroom. The cleanliness was lacking, and the quality of the food was disappointing. Adding to the discomfort, some passengers were loud, others were inconsiderate, and the cabin was filled with foul odors. When I asked the crew for help, I was surprised that the flight attendants could not speak English, which made communication difficult. Fortunately, after trying to communicate with two of them, a third flight attendant came. She spoke English and was kind and helpful, and eventually moved my daughter and me to better seats. Upon landing, several passengers ignored basic etiquette, got up prematurely, and acted in a disruptive manner. This flight was more like a crowded public bus than a flying experience. While Cathay Pacific is a reputable airline, the codeshare partnership with Air China could be damaging to its brand. I hope they reconsider these arrangements to maintain their high standards.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_20250128_153719-500x500.jpg,A320-200,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Chengdu,January 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,negative,0.8702141642570496,4.782952308654785,can opener
1392,1392,Air China,8,"""flight was very comfortable""",11th December 2024,True,"   First time travelled with Air China long haul. Being British with links to Hong Kong, we’ve mostly travelled with British Airways and Cathay Pacific in the past. With our holiday planning to Japan we had come across the attractive airfare offered by Air China in comparison with other well known international airlines. At first we were worried about the quality of flight experience and even fellow travellers on the planes. After reading on line reviews and watching You Tube clips. The thing that helped us make our decision wasn’t the price alone but the fact we could make a visa free 3 day stay over in Shanghai on our transit back to London. Basically two holidays in one trip. In my personal experience with Air China, we travelled on A350-900 aircraft to Shanghai. The flight was very comfortable, legroom was more than other airlines we travelled with on Economy. My daughter suffered from severe travel sickness and could not eat so they put a special sticker to show that. The flight attendants were very caring and attentive towards her. The toilets were well maintained compared to other airlines towards the end of the flight would be really dirty. Food was nothing special but not awful , good enough to keep you from being starved. Transit from Shanghai Pudong to Japan Narita was 3 hours but did not feel too long whereas in reality the whole trip (2 legs) were quite tiring indeed. We checked in on line with no problems however one of the legs did require us to collect our boarding passes from the airport rather than getting QR code to use from our mobile phones. Pudong to Narita was on a smaller aircraft and older but nothing to complain about as the in flight service was just as good. On our way returning to London, we encountered a little from at Narita . Although we had paid and reserved our chosen seats the system did not show that and two of us had been moved to less desirable seats further back. We explained the situation at the checkin counter and the ground staff sorted it efficiently offering us seats that were even better than the ones we originally chose. We had a seamless stay over in Shanghai for 3 days, luggage were collected at Pudong without any problems. The return flight from Pudong to London Gatwick was just as great. I hope people who have read negative stuff about Air China can give them a go to experience how good they really are. Do not get put off by some bad reviews they may have read on line.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_3159-500x500.jpeg,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,London to Tokyo via Shanghai,November 2024,4.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,yes,neutral,0.6719793081283569,5.8653764724731445,meatloaf

1410,1410,Air China,1,"""I was satisfied with the trip""",22nd April 2024,True,"  Air China rather surprised me and left good impression in overall after my journey. Might be due to reduced expectations before the trip based on their experience as rather budget airline, but I enjoyed the flight. The ticket price was surprisingly low, twice lower than alternative flight to Taiwan. But check-in luggage was included and the airline was very transparent about their fees. The website seams outdated and fails to load sometimes. Online check-in requires patience, as it might take multiple attempts to complete it. Airport check-in is on contrary fast. Due to operational requirements Air China flights in MXP are parked on remote stands, so boarding is done using stairways. The aircraft to Beijing was Airbus A350-900 - airline's most modern aircraft. The seat was comfortable, pleasant material, comfortable headrest, legroom was a bit small (I am 193cm), but would be rather sufficient for most travelers. IFE had a bit limited choices, but collection was rather up to date. There is a big choice of Chinese films and music and few games. After departure meals were served quite fast. The quality was ""okay"". The food felt as if it was stored frozen (which was the cause for both segments), but portions were decent size. Snacks were available on demand for the entire flight. The next flight was on A330-300, which is mostly used on regional routes (China and close international destinations), so cabin was a bit outdated, didn't feature an IFE and seats were rather hard with smaller legroom than A350. Headrest didn't regulate but for 3 hours flight to Taipei it was fine. As it was a morning flight, they offered breakfast. Every aircraft had a universal 110V power outlet, supporting European, US, Chinese and British plugs. On A350 USB outlet is also available. In general I was satisfied with the trip.

This was one of the nicer flights I've experienced on a narrow-body. First a few negatives - This is an old style Business Class seat (2x2) with no seat back monitors - just the overhead drop down TV which was useless, despite headphones supplied. Safety announcements were made by one crew member reading out from her note book (turning the pages swiftly) and the other demonstrating. However, the seat was comfortable with plenty of leg room. The cabin crew were just fantastic. Slippers were opened and handed to each passenger and informed of the flight time and seemed genuinely happy to serve. Hot towels were provided on boarding followed by a welcome fruit cocktail. I was then offered a second drink of Champagne. Drinks menus were handed out but no food menu. It was a choice of Western or Chinese main course and I opted for the Chinese meal. I was then offered a choice of drinks from the bar (a single malt whisky for me), and Chinese White Wine to go with the food. 20 minutes into the flight the bar service began. Dinner was served and the main fish course was very tasty. I was able to taste the wine first before pouring the rest. Again, refills followed. The desert was a strange cake like thing which I was not keen on. Later it was coffee and Cognac, and more refills followed! After the meal, I asked if I could keep the nice red chopsticks. They took the used ones away and returned with an unopened pair plus a souvenir Panda gift. As it was a night flight, the cabin was dimmed, but the crew checked on the passengers if there was anything else we wanted. During the 5 hour flight despite the little recline on the seat, I was able to nod off to about an hour. On the return flight, which also left on time, a Chinese breakfast was served with Dim Sum and Congee - very tasty.

These are the old style (2x2x2), with the window seat having no direct aisle access. The small fixed partition between the seats offered a little privacy, but only when full flat. The seat itself was very comfortable and the adjustments were easy to operate. Following a welcome Champagne drink and hot towel, the menus were handed out. The announcements included a clear warning/advise for passenger behaviour on board. The cabin was half full. While taxing, a crew member came to take my dinner order. Although there was a choice of three main courses, I was told they had only one choice for dinner and breakfast left!  For dinner,  small appetisers were served, followed by a seafood starter, salad and hot breads. The main fish course was OK but a little bland. However, a desert trolley came along and I was able to choose what I liked, and settled for cheese/crackers and ice cream. Plenty to eat, but not that great. The wine served was good, and topped up several times, before coffee and cognac. One of the crew came to apologise for the lack of choice in the food, but it was not a major issue. What impressed me was the smiling and attentive attitude of the crew. I have read negative reviews about Air China complaining about the lack of English spoken. But for me, that is the charm of communicating with others who may not be so perfect in other languages. I really enjoyed my flight, especially the friendly cabin crew. A large pillow and thick blanket was provided for sleeping. The IFE was not fantastic, with a very limited number of English movies. The L'Occitane amenity kit was also basic. On the 10 hour flight, I managed about 4 hours sleep. On my return flight, the sound quality of the announcements was poor, and I could hardly understand a word spoken. Yet it didn't deter me from enjoying a relaxing time. Considering Air China's low pricing in Business Class, I would fly them again.

The flight arrived late into Beijing and I missed the connecting flight to Los Angeles. They made everyone wait in an area for forty minutes, then put everyone in a bus that got lost twice and took ninety minutes to get to a hotel. No food was provided, my bathroom had no shower door and had a clogged sink. I was the only Caucasian amongst all Chinese. Not a word of English was spoken. When flying from Los Angeles to Shanghai five days earlier the same thing occurred. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing was cancelled due to weather and I was forced to spend the night in Beijing. Rather than accept their accommodation I took the money they offered, forty six dollars and found a four star hotel that cost $250. Air Canada had its passengers stay at the same, pricey but reasonable, hotel. The following day, after spending three hours on the tarmac, without any communication from the pilots, the flight finally departed for Shanghai. Returning from Shanghai I was wiser but no less lucky. My flight from Shanghai to Beijing showed that it would be delayed and I knew I would miss my connecting flight to Los Angeles. An hour prior to the flight leaving I informed the airline staff that I would miss my connecting flight and requested they instead arrange another one. I even showed them flight options on my phone. The answer was no answer. I had to take the flight or be left on my own in Shanghai, not knowing what would happen. I took the flight to Beijing and was then taken to the hotel. I kept asking myself, why can’t Air China run some very simple regression analysis to determine the chances of customers making flights given variables like seasonal weather patterns and historic flight delays. The only answer I could come up with was they either do not think it is important or do not know how to do it. Why do airports in China suffer some of the longest delays in the world? As mentioned in the Economist, “The first reason is that its airports err on the side of extreme safety.” This is consistent with state run ideology. Play it safe. No mistakes, and you won’t get in trouble. According the South China Morning Post, “Like the rest of the world, the biggest cause of delays according to CAAC is the weather, which accounted for 56 percent of flight delays ” No one thinks this excuse is legitimate.

Unfortunately this trip in their Premium Economy was not worth it, even allowing for different expectations. First, I rang to tell them that I was bringing 2x kitesurf bags. Their policy permits this provided you tell them at least 48 hours in advance (which I did, ringing 6 days prior). They flat out refused to take the second bag saying ""the hold was full"" (of cargo presumably). I pointed out I was flying for the sole purpose of kitesurfing and without the requisite equipment the holiday was ruined and the flight pointless.  The flight from LHR to CDG was fine. We were given a nice sandwich. The problem started on the CDG > GRU leg an 11 hour overnighter on a 777. The plane was shabby and old. There was no pre dinner drinks service with the drink served at the same time as the main meal - not what you want on an 11 hour flight departing in the evening. They had run out of Premium Economy food so I got Economy food and mine was disgusting - miserable and tasteless. My travelling companion got the Premium Economy meal which was almost as bad (there is it seems virtually no difference). The worst bit by far is the seat which does not recline and is as hard as a rock. Indeed the seat on the A220 for the 40 minute flight from London in economy was better than this seat. Truly terrible. On the return leg it was virtually impossible to check in to Gol (their Brasilian in country partner) as the Air France ticket locator code is not recognised on the Gol website. On GRU to CDG flight we at least got a drinks service. But the food was just as bad as before. I was offered a drink after the meal that was served in a cardboard cup. The seat was still like lying on a rock. Again no sleep possible on an overnight flight. Security going to the K gates was a lengthy and stressful mess. I realise this is not Air France's fault; but it is part of the Air France experience since that is where you have to change planes, so is relevant if you are thinking of booking. Overall the extra charged for their ""premium economy"" is simply not worth it. Things they need to do to fix it: 1. Live up to their promise and actually take your sports equipment instead of prioritising cargo. 2. Update their planes (the 777 was ancient) 3. Provide a proper drinks service 4. Upgrade the food 5. Upgrade the seats so they are comfortable and recline a bit, so you can sleep. 6. Make sure AF locator codes work on partner airlines for checkin 7.

They just moved his seat without any explanation when he prepaid and the flight attendant at the airport have no access to move my husband closer to us.

What really left me puzzled was how incredibly dirty the toilets were, already one hour into the flight. It was obvious no one really checked those toilets at any time. Furthermore the slowness in which the meal was served was disappointing. I am absolutely a fan of no rushed meals when a flight is 10+ hours and I love to take my time, but on this flight it took a full hour before we were served an aperitif and another hour for the meal to be served. At the end of the meal, we were already 3.5 hours into our flight with another seven to go and two hours before landing breakfast was served. Of course one may skip the breakfast and sleep a little longer, but it is hard if all cabin lights are being put on and there is action in the aisles.

The breakfast was much worse - I chose scrambled eggs and vegetables (in a hope that this would be basic enough for not being screwed up), and I was wrong. It was the worst breakfast I had in years.

1780,1780,Air France,5,“I felt squeezed in”,28th January 2024,True,"  I flew to Bucharest out of HND via CDG in Business Class with Air France. In the first leg, on seating myself on a business class seat, I felt squeezed in. Whenever I got out of my seat for a rest room or something, I could not help grabbing the backrest of the seat just in front of mine, which finally caused him to make a complaint to me. For dinner, no Japanese food was available. More than that, the main Western course they served was not suitable for my typical Japanese taste. However, I found it logical, because one of the roles AF assumes is to spread French culture. After dinner ample refreshments ,such as fruits, chocolates, and biscuits were presented with a bottle of champagne at the galley. It was the so-called help-yourself service. On the other hand, I did see what I didn’t want to see: not a few flight attendants were bent on chatting each other. They didn’t intend to replace an empty bottle with a new one. Two hours prior to arrival, as regular breakfast was served, French butter, regrettably whose brand name I forgot, was noteworthy. In the second leg, regular European business class with middle seat empty. The meal served here was tasty (see photo). The portion of cheese was impressive. Serving generous amount of champagne was highly appreciated.

I was asked by the staff to check in at the premium economy counter. I had booked a flexible business class ticket and my luggage allowance was 35 kg. The check-in employee working at premium economy did not understood the luggage allowance for business class and asked me to pay extra for being over 20 kg luggage. I showed him my tickets and the 35 kg luggage allowance was clearly mentioned, but he still did not understood. He pressurised me to pay extra for the luggage. I refused to be checked in and spoke to the staff and went back to the really long queue waiting at business class counter. During check-in at the business class counter, I was informed that the premium economy check-in person has already added an overweight luggage alert to my ticket and I will have to pay extra even though I was well within the allowed luggage allowance. More than 1 hour was already wasted in this process and I was getting late for the flight. The premium economy check in-person left his desk and approached me and asked me to pay in cash and no receipt was provided. I asked to speak to a senior or a customer complaints team member, but this premium economy person informed that if I wanted to lodge a complaint I could email the customer care. I had to pay him cash to clear the overweight alert and to process my boarding pass. Overall an absolutely absolutely disgusting experience with Air India business class.

Unfortunately the weight of the puppy with the carrier cage was more than 2 kg over the limit and also there was another pet that was also travelling in the flight. So I had no option but to let him travel along with the cargo. But unlike what you expect from normal ground staff, the AI staff (Suchitra and her team) was really instrumental in giving all help and support to my puppy and me. They arranged a place for me to wait with him till the boarding was almost complete and then only was I parted from my pet. Also I was able to see that they personally took him to the ramp until he was safely loaded in the cargo hold. Also they did a follow-up check at night ensuring my pet was safe and sound when he reached Delhi.

Today, as we have always done in the past years for international departures, we stopped our taxi midway or slightly further up the taxi lanes at Delhi IGI Airport for our 5th January 2025, 2:45 AM flight AI162 from Delhi to London Heathrow. Once inside, we found the Air India counters at the very first spot, Section A, where only local or national departures are typically situated. We had to tread all the way with our heavy luggage, even though we used the services of two paid porters at INR 500 per porter. The Air India staff seemed perpetually exhausted, and no one wanted to check us in, each trying to pass us on to the next colleague. At most counters, printers were broken, or staff were missing from their seats. The ones at their counters gave such disapproving looks that you’d feel blamed just for approaching them! It took them 20 to 30 minutes just to check in one family of three members. After finally being checked in, we headed to immigration clearance near the Air India counters, only to be told that this section was for national departures. We were instructed to go back from Section A/1 to the middle of the airport, starting from Section 7 onwards. Once again, we had a long walk from one end of the departure lounge to the other, a good 10 to 15-minute walk. We joined a long queue for immigration clearance, followed by repeated self-security checks, with multiple checks at every step. The security personnel at the counters seemed unnecessarily strict. Finally, we had a long walk to Gate 10A, taking another 20 minutes or more.

Surprisingly, I entered the flight with great condition, it was almost new airbus, with very good seat across economy and business class. The condition of seat is comparable fairly to other airlines such as Lufthansa, which I am frequent flyer with them. The crews were amazing!

Before take off a ground crew member came onboard to inform me the entertainment system at my seat was not working. I was given the following 3 options: Option #1 They would try and get me on a flight the next day. I was traveling for business with multiple meetings booked for my arrival in Delhi which could not be changed. I declined this offer. Option #2 downgrade to economy. I declined this offer. Option #3 sign a form giving me Rs 10,000 credit, approximately $180AUD. I accepted this offer however considering my flight was 12 hours with no entertainment the compensation offered was extremely disappointing, inadequate and not reflective of the situation I was faced with. The most shocking part of the flight which was completely inappropriate were the crew members that took their sleep breaks in seat E & F of row 1 business class seats. In total I counted 6 different crew taking their sleep breaks for around 45min - 1hour with some even changing into sleepwear. Absolutely appalling! I did not pay a full business class fare to be seated in a crew rest area, unexceptionable and disgraceful. At what stage of air travel did crew sleep in passenger seats let alone in business class. Throughout my flight it was exceedingly difficult to get a crew members attention, even after pressing my call button crew would walk straight pass my seat which I witnessed this among other passengers as well. I had to get up from me seat twice during my flight to go and ask a crew member in the galley for assistance. Non of the crew were helpful or polite and I was made to feel like I was an inconvenience to their journey. I contact Air India via email following my flight regarding the crew taking their rest breaks in the Business Class cabin, astonishingly I was informed that “crew are permitted to rest in vacant seats”.

Almost all entertainment screens were broken - dirty floor and seats with stains - no water or toilet paper in the toilets - horrible food especially for people who can't handle spicy or lentils well - seats in A320 ridiculously close to each other, got constantly slammed by the guy in front of me. This felt even worse than Ryanair but they're at least cheap, also there was no entertainment on 4hr flight - security at Delhi Airport steals your vape and lighter even if you just transit but let's you pass with a custom half liter bottle with an unknown substance? I have no understanding for this behaviour at all, Security also was unfriendly and arrogant. Absurdly high fees for change of flight data if ticket not eligible for online change (360€ for 1 day later), might be like this with other carriers as well but I don't like it. Actually the only good thing I can say is that you can take 2 big suitcases while Air France, KLM, Lufthansa ... try to rip you off here and offer long distance flight fares even without any luggage which messes up the results of flight search engines.

On both flights, a pre-meal drink of fruit juice and prosecco (no champagne) was offered.

The presentation was excellent in traditional Maltese ceramicware, known as 'Zingla' bowls. Lunch followed by coffee and drinks from the bar.

Air Malta staff appeared unaware of our redirected flight and was unable to answer our requests for assistance. Malta is connected regularly via ferries and speedy boats to Sicily but the Air Malta staff told us that there would have been an announcement in 20 minutes time.

Passengers were worried, and we started asking for bottles of water and lunch voucher but they kept saying there would be an announcement in a minutes. We could have been transferred to Sicily by ferry boat or speedy boats but instead Air Malta spending time agreeing a strategy: useless to contact them by phone as the operators were keeping saying that the number was only for reservations. After 5 hours standing up, without drinking nor eating the staff told us to move at the check in desk for the flight to Rome that would land in Catania first. We moved at the check-in desk but the staff at the desk was unaware that would land to Catania and denied us to check in.

We would have already been in Catania if the flight would have departed on time but Catania Airport shut down again at 9.30 pm. The captain went out from the cabin and called the police to force us to leave the airplane. The situation was unreal: children crying, an adult having a crisis that required the assistance of a doctor, the police shouting against frustrated passengers stressing them even more until when they started forcedly removing our hand luggage. At that point we had no option than return to the terminal. After 3 hours we received our first and only light meal for the Costa Coffee and a hotel accomodation. Nobody wanted to get stuck in Sliema because of lack of transportation (it has not been offered to us) on Christmas day so the majority decided to sleep on the ground or in the seats of the Costa Coffee in the airport. At 5 am we queued at the check-in, we received our boarding pass and we arrived in Comiso at around 8.30 am on Christmas day; from Comiso a shuttle bus brought us to Catania airport, were our parents were waiting for us.

I’ve read some bad reviews about the airline and its aging A340s, but I was pleasently surprised actually. The flight departed on time, and the loadfactor was around 70-80 percent. The legroom was sufficient, and the seats were comfortable with a nice headrest en decent recline. Even when the person in front of me reclined the seat I didn’t feel cramped. The only downside was the lack of IFE, as around half of the PTVs on board weren’t working. The cabin crew was very friendly and professional. Both meals were tasty (dinner and breakfast), but were a bit small. As I slept most of the flight I’m not sure how the service between the meals was.

2472,2472,Air Namibia,1,"""Never fly with Air Namibia""",2nd March 2019,True,"  Cape Town to Windhoek. Never fly with Air Namibia, flew back to Frankfurt via Windhoek on 17.02.2019 after a four-week holiday in Cape Town. The problem actually started when checking in in Cape Town. We have never experienced such unfriendly and unwilling groundworkers who refuse work. The highlight of the outrage was, however, that for my golf baggage that the approved dimensions exceeded by as much as 6cm, a transport fee of 2 322, - Rand (about € 150, -) was charged. The checking-in employee put on his tape measure until he really came to the 6 cm. Of course we did not agree and tried by all means to avoid this arbitrary charge. Unfortunately, we have come to the wrong address with the two colleagues. Neither Ziupad nor Sean (Supervisor) were in any way willing to compromise. They shone through ignorance and unimaginable stubbornness, combined with a rudeness that is second to none. Even my objection that the luggage on the way in Franfkfurt in any way appreciated and simply waved, the situation did not improve. After much discussion in the course of which I wanted to speak to the supervisor, they even did not shy away from letting the police come to the counter. We paid a total of € 4423.16 for the flight. And then this very nice holiday was completely messed up by this action. That was just the beginning of a flight full of mishaps. On the connecting flight to Frankfurt, I can only confirm what the travelers from France (N Ranelle) from 29.10.2018 had experienced before me. Very unfriendly crew. The two business class toilets were blocked for hours by the crew. Entertainment System failed in more than half of Business Class. No magazines. Seats only mediocre. Drink service during the night not available. The top, however, was the Business Lounge in Windhoek. Ripped sofas, makeshift louvered ceilings. Dirty carpeting, plastic cutlery and dishes. I have attached pictures. Unfortunately, I also have to say that the airline does not manage to keep any aircraft or building in order. Everything is used until it falls apart. In the future, we will fly to South Africa only Arab or Asian airlines, even if we will be traveling longer. For a stay of more than four weeks, this is not so significant and is more than offset by the friendly and perfect service, the modern airplanes and business lounges with smaller money.  Leider auch bei uns: Nie mehr mit Air Namibia fliegen, wir sind am 17.02.2019 nach einem vier-wöchigen Urlaub in Kapstadt zurück nach Frankfurt über Windhoek geflogen. Das Problem ging eigentlich schon beim Einchecken in Kapstadt los. So ein unfreundliches und unwilliges, arbeitsverweigerndes Bodenpersonal haben wir noch nicht erlebt. Der Höhepunkt der Unverschämtheiten war aber der, dass mir für mein Golfgepäck, dass die zugelassenen Maße um sage und schreibe 6cm übertraf, eine Beförderungsgebühr von 2.322,-- Rand (ca. € 150,--) in Rechnung gestellt wurde. Der eincheckende Mitarbeiter legte sein Maßband so oft an, bis er wirklich auf die 6 cm kam. Natürlich waren wir damit nicht einverstanden und versuchten mit allen Mitteln, diese willkürliche Gebühr zu vermeiden. Doch leider sind wir bei den beiden Kollegen an die falsche Adresse geraten. Weder Ziupad noch Sean (Supervisor) zeigten sich in irgendeiner Weise kompromißbereit. Sie glänzten durch Ignoranz und unvorstellbarer Sturheit, verbunden mit einer Unfreundlichkeit, die ihresgleichen sucht. Auch mein Einwand, dass das Gepäck auf dem Hinflug in Franfkfurt in keiner Weise gewürdigt und einfach durchgewinkt wurde, verbesserte die Situation nicht. Nach heftiger Diskussion in deren Verlauf ich dne Vorgesetzten sprechen wollte, scheuten sie sich sogar nicht, die Polizei zum Schalter kommen zu lassen. Wir haben für den Flug insgesamt € 4423,16 bezahlt.  Und dann wurde uns dieser sehr schöne Urlaub durch diese Aktion komplett versaut.  Das war nur der Anfang eines Fluges voller Pannen. Bei dem Anschlußflug nach Frankfurt kann ich nur bestätigen, was die Reisenden aus Frankreich (N Ranelle) vom 29.10.2018 vor mir erlebt hatten. Sehr unfreundliche Crew. Die beiden Business Class Toilietten wurden stundenlang von der Crew blockiert. Entertainment System bei mehr als der Hälfte der Business Class ausgefallen. Keine Zeitschriften. Sitze auch nur mittelmäßig. Getränkeservice während der Nacht nicht vorhanden. Die Spitze war allerdings die Business Lounge in Windhoek. Zerfetzte Sofas, notdürftig mit Decken kaschiert. Dreckiger Teppichboden, Plastik-Besteck und Geschirr. Ich habe Bilder beigefügt. Leider muß ich auch hier feststellen, dass es die Airline nicht schafft, weder Flugzeuge noch Gebäude in Stand zuhalten. Es wird alles so lange benutzt, bis es auseinander fällt. Wir werden in Zukunft nach Südafrika nur noch arabischen oder asiatischen Airlines fliegen, auch wenn wir dadurch länger unterwegs sein werden. Bei einem Aufenthalt von mehr als vier Wochen fällt dies aber nicht so ins Gewicht und wird durch den freundlichen und perfekten Service, die modernen Flugzeuge und Business Lounges bei kleinerem Geld mehr als wett gemacht.

The A330 is a modern aircraft and the cabin was modern and the seats comfortable. During this flight we had two meals which were good but no more. On this flight there is no wifi and the inflight entertainment was really bad - a little choice of films only available in two languages. For me the worst thing on this flight is the cabin staff.

He went the extra mile to help out with a difficult situation. I noticed on the steps to the aeroplane that I had left one of my hand luggage items in the restaurant in the departure lounge. This was a tragedy for me because the item was a very large framed photograph (shown below) I had taken of my son-in-law, and was meant to be his Christmas present. The steward immediately offered to find out whether it could be retrieved but there was too little time left before take-off. Later on he gave me a cell phone number to enquire with assurance that something could be done. When I phoned that number the following morning, I had little hope of any success but to my surprise the steward himself answered the phone, told me that the picture had been found and will be kept safely until my return from Namibia on 27th December. I ask him if there was any chance of getting the photograph to Walvisbay, seeing that it is a special Christmas present? He said he will see what he can do and will let me know.

The business premier seats now just feel old and poorly thought out. I don't want to directly face every single person boarding the plane. For some stupid reason face away from the window and directly at your fellow passengers. They have a distinct lack of privacy. The seat and cracks were dirty and dusty, it didn't appear to have been cleaned in quite some time, including previous passengers earbuds sitting clearly visible. As I write this onboard I can see fingerprint smears on the seat across from me. Nothing has been wiped down. I did bring this to the attention of the attendant, who did take the feedback and assured would pass it on with thanks. The food was just average. The movie & entertainment selection was pitiful, clearly lacking choice. Further to this anyone who has had to contact and deal with Air new Zealands contact centre in the past year probably understands how dreadful it is. Expect multiple hour wait times just to speak to someone if calling from abroad. I don't know if anyone from Air New Zealand reads this or cares.

Also tiny school backpack forced to check. Never do I have to check. While some passengers brought 2 to 3 times bigger bags on without checking. This agent ruined my otherwise pleasant experience in bocas. Don’t buy anything over there that’s not made of wood basically. Hate you Air Panama.

Flight was only 50mins so not a problem. Plane does have a toilet. It's not like flying a major international airline, but its a short flight and was a good experience. They even gave us umbrellas to walk to the plane as it had started to rain which was a nice touch. I'd seen other negative reviews so was pleasantly surprised how professional and polite their staff were. I'd use them again. It's difficult to rate the actual on board service because there really isn't any, no entertainment or food / drinks but it's such a short flight it's not that relevant.

However, Air Serbia closes their check-in at 12.30 pm so they were long gone by the time we got there. After calling them for 20 min finally got someone on the phone who basically was useless and told us they can't really help us much and I need to un-check in from this flight we missed! So other employees at the airport were telling us we are screwed. Air Serbia was huge disappointment. From some, unpleasant, non-smiling flight attendants that didn't check on you occasionally, offer coffee or water, speeding down aisle, not picking up your trash. No power on a plane and devices not working, 10 hours in the air with no working devices or ability to charge phones. Only kudos we can send is to the pilots- thank you for very smooth and safe flight. Probably the best pilots out there fly Air Serbia planes.

2888,2888,Air Seychelles,1,Air Seychelles customer review,19th September 2021,True,"  I had booked flight back from Praslin airport where we had our hotel Lemuria back to Mahe for our international flight. So we booked flight at 5th of may directly in the airport, becouse it was near our hotel. So my trip back to Mahe was like scary movie, and all of a service for the Air Seychelles was awfull. First of all - our flight was booked for 9th may - thats sunday, this is a day off at the airport - so nobody will take phone, nobody will answer you on email, and only service for flight who dont know anything will work at the airport. Be very careful to use their flights on Sundays. In the morning 9th of may at the day of our departure we noticed that a storm comes to an islands, but we saw flights still are going, and nobody told us that something will be wrong (we had flight at 18 -40), so we packed everything and were preparing to leave. Thanks to Lemuria hotel crew at 12 o clock we were told that the airport is closed and there will be no flights today, they also sent their man to have duty in the airport if something else happened, and he called every 30 minutes. Air Seychelles didn't even get in touch with us in that day, didn't answer the phones etc. The ferry that goes only 2 times a day was already sold completely for that day. So we and other passengers had to book boats not to miss their international flights. When we arrived to the airport for our flight, planes from Air Seychelles still were not flying, and we get back home. After we get home I sent email and all information air Seychelles manager asked us for ticket refund, and we get only about 30% of money for our tickets, because we were charged for ""no show"" at non working airport, and refund charge. That's a total disgrace.  If you use them you should have some additional money for private boats.

2969,2969,Air Tahiti Nui,1,"""Business Class product was terrible""",19th October 2022,True,"  Their lack of care, lack of support and lack of customer service is monumental. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and heading to Bora Bora. Air Tahiti from LAX to Papeete and then on Air Tahiti (regional carrier) to Bora Bora. About 2 hours prior to our late night flight, Air Tahiti Nui cancelled the flight. The reason was that the incoming aircraft was struck by lightning. Understanding that safety is paramount and absolutely the most important factor of traveling, we understood that the aircraft had to be inspected. Keep in mind that Air Tahiti Nui only has like 4 aircraft in their fleet so it's not like they can quickly bring in a new aircraft. We were shuttled to an airport hotel at LAX and told to come back in the next day as the flight would now depart at 2pm. Back to LAX we went and learned that Air Tahiti Nui kept delaying the flight with no information or communication to the passengers. When a Gate Agent did appear, we were advised that they are third party employees and have no further details. All this while we were watching tape being put on the front of the aircraft where it was struck by lightning. After hours again in LAX, the flight finally departed. Upon arrival in Tahiti there was no one from Air Tahiti Nui to provide hotel vouchers (as the majority of passengers were connecting to neighboring islands and there were no regional flights out that late). There was a line of about 200+ passengers waiting for some assistance from one woman sitting in the Air Tahiti office! After hours of waiting we were put up in literally a dump of a motel for the night. Knowing that the flight was cancelled the previous day, why would they not have staff ready to assist their passengers as well as hotel vouchers for those stuck in Papeete. Take my recommendation, fly an alternate carrier if going to Tahiti. Their Business Class product was terrible. 2x2x2 seating on a 787 where others offer plenty more room. Inflight entertainment was very limited and food was ""just OK' but nothing I would expect from a flag carrier. Internet never worked and while flight attendant service was very cordial, it certainly does not make up for their lack of customer service.

2982,2982,Air Tahiti Nui,1,"""I would look elsewhere""",13th February 2020,True,"  
This was the first time flying Air Tahiti Nui.  My goal was to fly from LAX to PPT (Tahiti) then PPT to BOB (Bora Bora). The nightmare started on our flight from LAX to PPT. Discovered Air Tahiti Nui does not have a designated ticket counter so you can only check in 2 hours before flight departs. This caused an issue because in order to gain access to any club lounge you need a boarding pass. Our flight arrived in LAX about 5 hours before the LAX to PPT departed so had to sit and wait in LAX for 3 hours until Air Tahiti Nui ticket counter opened. By that time there was a long line of people and the staff at Air Tahiti Nui did not seem to care how fast they processed people. So we were not able to go to our lounge and eat and relax so we had to pay for our lunch and stand around because of very limited seating in the lobby of LAX. After checking our bags we went to the gate displayed on my ticket and on the overhead boards and on my flight app. Several people started going up the the gate ticket counter asking why boarding had not started with only 10 minutes before our flight was suppose to depart. No answers. Staff simply did not seem to care. Five minutes before boarding an announcement was made of a gate change to 153 which was about 1/2 mile away all the way down to the other end of the concourse. We ran to the the other end only to wait 1.5 hours to board with more delays and no explanation. During this time I talked to a couple the long time LAX employees. They stated this happens all the time with Air Tahiti Nui. During our flight we purchase exit row seats. The Air Tahiti Nui staff allowed long lines to queue up and use our exist row areas as acceptable areas for people to stand and stretch, causing people to step on our feet several times. We brought this to the attention of the staff but they did not seem to care. Service was touted a very friendly and a great Tahitian experience. Do not believe what they tell you and show in their slick ads. We had a similar experience on way back. Sorry but once from LAX to PPT and PPT to LAX was enough. There are a lot of other airline choices like Air France etc. I would look elsewhere. Hopefully this review helped describe our experience. Even more concerning is we did not find Tahiti the friendly place to stay either.

We even double checked everything with the cargo office the day prior to the flight. Thankfully, the pilot happened to notice the animals being loaded onto the plane and stopped the process the morning of the flight. The cargo hold had no oxygen and they would've died.

I  mentioned it to the Attendant while being greeted coming aboard and she simply, “well all those people did” (gesturing to the 8 of the 12 people seated in Club Class).  So after paying for Club Class, what was our reward - arriving at our seats to find the overhead cabins were unavailable. Understandable, as they are used for staff/plane storage. Acceptable but no alternative immediately available until the gentleman seated next to us offered us space. For the extra value spent, it was a horrible beginning to a long-awaited trip to Spain. Hoping our return trip is much better! In todays challenging environment, it seems like customer service is hit or miss.

Even the best in the world like Qatar, Emirates and Singapore Airlines rarely have ratings above 7/10 because passengers mostly come to Skytrax to air their grievances but never sing praises whenever the job is done well. Booking a lie-flat business class seat on AirAsia X’s Airbus A330 was probably the most value-for-money upgrade around. For just about USD50 more I got to enjoy a lie-flat seat, meal service and upsized baggage. Most certainly it isn’t full-service business class like on the full-service carriers, but at this price point there really isn’t much room for dissatisfaction especially when the crew did their job well. Most importantly the flight departed on time and landed safely on time. Overall a very pleasant experience with AirAsia X, and in my opinion a massive difference as compared to the regular AirAsia.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/3D38679A-2277-4DA4-8013-7321EB55F3F2-500x500.jpeg,A330-343,Business,Business Class,Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok,October 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,,5.0,yes,positive,0.5084366798400879,8.36076831817627,ambulance

3642,3642,airBaltic,1,“Shame on you AirBaltic”,4th February 2025,True," It's a shame I cannot recommend this airline for the following reasons. I was due to fly from Belgrade to Riga with AirBaltic in August 2024 with my partner. We are both disabled, were wearing our sunflower lanyards and additionally I was walking with a stick. As we were waiting to board we were called out of line and told that due to overbooking we would not be able to board the flight. I told the staff that we had onward connections booked and we would miss the connections bvecause of this, I also informed them that we're both disabled and we were still denied boarding. This is a breach of the EU261/2004 Article 11 which basically states that disabled persons must be given priority to board over non-disabled passengers. We were then booked onto another flight with a connection in Buidapest to arrive in Riga around 1700 instead of 0600. When I again mentioned the issue of our onward connection we were told that the staff in Riga would help us with this. We were then put on the flight via Budapest. When we arrived in Budapest we requested assistance from the Air Baltic staff we were told to take care of ourselves. At this stage it was obvious we would have to probably stay overnight in Riga and travel onwards the next day to Tallinn. This meant we had to cut Vilnius out of our itinerary and lose a day of our holiday. When we arrived in Riga we were given EU261 compensation of EUR250 for the denied boarding and when I asked for help with the accommodation and the onward travel we were told to book it ourselves and claim it back from AirBaltic. When I tried to claim this back from Air Baltic I was then told that because they had paid us the EUR 250 that they weren't obliged to repay our expenses. When I replied that under EU261/2004 Article 9 the Airline was obliged to provide Accommodation where a stay of one or more nights becomes necessary in addition the Airline was obliged to offer transport between the accommodation and support in the way of telephone calls, emails etc None of this was offered - The only assistance we received was a meal at Belgrade Airport. As far as the Air Baltic staff cared my partner and I could have been wandering the streets of Riga overnight. I replied to Air Baltic quoting the legislation that they had breached and they haven't replied, I wrote to Air Baltic at their Head Office in Riga and they haven't replied. They have also rendered their customer care commitment null and void. Said commitment reads 'If you are involuntarily denied boarding and have complied with our check-in and other applicable rules, we will give you a written statement that describes your rights. We will also rebook you to next fastest connection, offer refreshments, meal, hotel and transportation (if necessary) as well as pay compensation as prescribed by the Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council.'

Common for high pricing tickets, you should allow more hand luggage. 2) If the hand luggage is a bit more than 8 kg, at the airport you have to pay 60 euro extra.

The ground service team (gate control) before letting people on board is just terrible.  First of all everyone got their hand luggage checked with a ride attitude, and if you even had 100 grams over the absurd 8 kg limit, you must pay 60 euros to get in. that 8 kg limit also includes anything you bought in the duty free store in the airport.  Now to my experience flying with my already small violin case. As in most airlines, musicians, most specifically violin players are allowed to bring their violin case on board without extra charge, because if you can't place it in the overhead locker (if it is already full because of other people luggage) then it just easily goes under the seat. That being said, the flight was half empty. And the boarding gate control knew it. Nonetheless, they looked for every opportunity to cash money in. But with music instruments is a whole another thing. You see, we cannot allow them to be placed in the hold. There are countless examples the one of a kind and highly valuable wooden music instruments that get placed in the hold are crushed or beyond repair, because of the temperature and the their fragile state. That's why also oversized music instruments, such as cellos, can be taken on board. The most horrible thing is that the gate control had the audacity to demand me payment without even letting me see the rules about music instruments. And they demanded that the already small violin case is being taken in to the hold. With the knowledge that the flight is half empty! I don't understand how cruel a person can be. And if it were not for the understanding stewardess, then we would not be taking the flight.

If they could have called me to come and get my luggage, why did they not call me cause I was at the airport, checked in online at 8am, checked in a bag, and they still left me.

For the menu they began by serving a drink, followed by a sub-lunch with the option of coffee or tea. A few minutes later, air hostesses came around offering a drink one last time before the plane’s descent. I am glad they added coffee or tea to the sub-lunch as the lunch alone is not very filling. My first sub-lunch consisted of: rolled smoked turkey slices, creamy honey mustard pasta shells, butternut and feta salad. For dessert, which was my favourite delicacy of the sub-lunch, was the custard and jelly topped with white and brown chocolate shavings. Not sure whether that’s what it actually is, however that is how I would describe it. Final part of dessert is a gourmet fudge which was over sweetened in my opinion. I have a sweet tooth, however this treat was too sweet. My second sub-lunch, I forgot to capture the menu of the second sub-lunch, however I did snap a picture of the food so here’s me writing the meal in my own words: rice, baloney style beef and corn salad. Dessert was the same as the first meal. Food tasted delicious. I appreciate the sub-lunch not being too heavy. Plus the flight is short-lived, therefore a heavy meal is not necessary. To add, they have Schweppes lemonade on board. The refresher towel which came along the sub-lunch was useful in sanitising my hands and dining tray. The Embraer-190 is small but durable.  Return trip I booked a window seat with grand views. It was fascinating viewing the outline of South Africa colliding with the massive blue waters of the Atlantic Ocean, with all the shaping exactly how it’s portrayed in the maps. When flying over Windhoek I gazed through my window and was blown away by the 42 000 feet view of Windhoek’s terrains. Below me was a collection of mountains and shrubs. Airlink is gentle with luggage and cabin crew is polite and hospitable. A free copy of Airlink’s in-flight magazine in the front pocket. There is no in flight entertainment, which is understandable since the flight was short lived. It is worth mentioning if you intend to tag a suitcase along as hand luggage, they will collect it pre-flight and you shall receive it on arrival since the overhead cabins cannot accommodate larger suitcases.

3896,3896,AJet,3,“worst catering I have had in 27 years”,16th August 2024,True," I was looking on Turkish Airlines' website for a return flight from Istanbul to Diyarbakir. The outward flight at the time I wanted was on Ajet. Although shown in the Turkish Airlines' computer, it made me go to Ajet site to book. So I did that and then came back to Turkish Airlines to book my return ticket. Entering the aircraft was like stepping back in time. Old fashioned ceiling and wall panels, small luggage bins, no video screens. After take-off there was a line of people waiting for the toilet until the crew realized it had been locked during departure, but had not been unlocked after take-off. A Turkish Airlines cart was brought through the cabin from which cold snacks and soft drinks were available for sale. I bought a sandwich and drink. One bite of the sandwich told it was cold, dry and stodgy. I looked inside and as you can see in the photo there was a miniscule amount of butter (maybe not even butter) on both sides of the bread. It was undoubtedly the worst catering I have had from Turkish Airlines in 27 years flying on them. Later I saw what were obviously hot crew meal entrees being taken to the rear galley. I hope they at least had something good to eat! Adding the cost of my sandwich and drink, I paid more on Ajet than for my flight back on Turkish Airlines. The crew were polite, with a few smiles. One of the crew 'uniforms' was navy blue and green, another all red and a third all grey. I only saw three of the crew. The recorded announcements were clear and understandable, but live ones were at double speed and mostly unintelligible. Credit where credit is due, the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early. I had worried about this when I saw that the preceding Tehran flight on the same aircraft was over nine hours delayed. Will I fly Ajet again?

I immediately seek assistance. The baggage claim agent on 9/02, did a lot to try and help me. He tried calling the crew/gate agent or the cleaning service to see if they could look for my phone. We told me that everyone was gone because it was a late flight. Early in the morning is when the plane will be searched and cleaned for its next flight. I return on 9/03 to baggage claim to see if anything was turned in. These were of no help. They told me to file a claim (I did that the night before). They asked me to call the customer service number, I said with what phone? I stayed at the desk for 40 min on hold. Tried asking the baggage claim manager for assistance, she laughed and walked away. According to my find your phone, my phone was in Reno then California and now Mexico. I kept trying to have an agent contact the crew or gate agents so that my seat could be thoroughly checked. I was told there is no way to connect this people. Which I find strange. If the pilot's parents died, no one can contact them to give the news? I think not. Currently, I was told that my phone was not on the San Fran Return flight and may still be in Mexico. The issue is the lack of efficiency and protocol for lost items. If the plane was thoroughly checked on 9/02, my phone would be in Seattle (where I am). If it was thoroughly check in Reno or Bakersfield my phone would be closer to being returned to me. Now its in Mexico? I have asked multiple agents what happens when my phone is not returned? What is my compensation? No one has answered my questions.

However the flight attendants on this flight seem to be fit and are not overweight at all, which is mind boggling to me because neither one of them walking by that pushed bumped or ran into my arm with the cart are overweight or obese so in my mind there’s no reason why they should be bumping me in the aggressive way they have been this whole flight so far. Neither of them apologized or even acknowledged me when they did bump into me I find it very unprofessional and unpleasant and I don’t plan on flying with Alaska again after this experience. Even someone on the plane twice the size of Gail turned to where she wasn’t bumping into me. And if that doesn’t prove that these terrible flight attendants have no respect or self awareness then I don’t know what does.

4226,4226,Allegiant Air,3,"“claim to be pet friendly, but it was not”",31st May 2024,False," Allegiant is very popular in my town as the only airline at our small airport. Direct flights into other small airports. It is well known that it's a no frills type of service. I have flown with them prior, and had no issues. But this time I traveled due to an ailing friend who died during my visit. I decided last minute that I couldn't let her cat go to a shelter. So we put her in an approved carrier and I paid to bring her home. She's a quiet gentle kitty, but was meowing as we boarded the loud plane. Though I hardly knew the cat, she had been quiet, only making noise when being moved around. So when the stewardess came to me and threatened to have me kicked off the plane if I didn't get her quieted immediately, I was shocked and dismayed. Already distraught over losing a friend, and now wondering and hoping I can make new kitty's presence work in my home, I sure didn't need someone making impossible demands. I had never flown with an animal like that. Some, more sympathetic passengers, offered advice of tranquilizers, etc. But I was in the pickle NOW. I really didn't want to miss this flight! They moved the passenger in front of me. But kitty quieted once we took off and hardly made a peep the rest of the flight. I was in tears off and on during the 2 hour flight, realizing this cat was all I had left of my friend. It made it difficult to communicate with passengers, or the crew. I realize that's a personal problem, but a real part of my experience, here. It is the next day, and I still feel traumatized by the whole ordeal. I wish they were more specific about pet travel in their policy explanation. I really had no clue that a generally quiet, but a temporarily meowing cat was reason to be removed from a plane! I have traveled with children and babies screaming, but never heard anyone suggest drugs to shut them up, and never a threat to kick them off! I will likely use Allegiant again because of the convenience. But I just want to forewarn others who might be considering taking a pet. They claim to be pet friendly, but it was not my experience.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Screenshot_20240531_140222_Gallery-500x500.jpg,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,"Providence, RI to Punta Gorda, FL ",May 2024,3.0,1.0,,3.0,,,3.0,yes,positive,0.5935344099998474,5.482466220855713,Egyptian Mau

They should be ashamed of how they “handle” their consistent, returning, paying customers. I boarded my flight, row 4, and as usual, no overhead space for my carry on luggage. The flight attendants offered no assistance in trying to find space in the overhead compartments, and said, “you just have to look”. They also do not police patrons who board first, sitting further back, who just wanna throw their luggage up in front by so they can just grab it and go once we’ve reached our destination. I flew with 2 friends who managed to find spots, I however did not, so my luggage was taken by a flight attendant, who said it would be complementary checked, and was then taken off the plane. When we arrived at our destination, I went to the baggage claim, and when I saw my luggage, I couldn’t believe my eyes! The handle on my luggage literally was snapped clean off. No note, no one to meet me to explain its condition, just my bag circling the carousel with the broken off handle laying on top of my luggage. Went to customer service, directed to the Allegiant counter, filled out the claim form and was told that a representative would be contacting me. Received an email requesting pictures, the cost of my luggage, my mailing address and phone number, which gave me hope that perhaps compensation would be made. I am sharing my experience along with pictures of the condition of my luggage before I boarded the plane and then when I claimed it at the airport. I followed the instructions I was given. Not to mention I paid a carry-on charge of $30 which I feel I should be refunded since they took my luggage off the plane. Following is an email I received from Allegiant. Allegiant Air takes no responsibility for or accepts any liability for damage to my luggage and basically blamed me for having what they say is luggage with wear and tear not sustainable to the various handlings of luggage. My luggage is not very old and in perfect condition. So I guess this means they feel it was susceptible to damage.

We waited, they said they cannot cancel the tickets as they don't have booking counter at that particular airport. Then we had not other option, and finally they left the airport at 18:30hrs.

4440,4440,American Airlines,1,“my seat was broken”,6th November 2024,True," I purchased a Flagship 1st Class ticket for a long haul, lie flat seat to Rome from Dallas. The price was approximately $3800 dollars with a standard ticket costing about $700 at the time. Due to a knee injury, it was important for me to have the ability to lie flat, which is why I purchased that specific seat type. Upon boarding the flight, I was unaware my seat was broken. After the flight reached a safe altitude to adjust our seats, the captain allowed us to unbuckle our seatbelts and walk around the cabin. I realized my electronic control panel was not working and I was unable to move my seat. I called Michelle and Mats, the flight attendants serving our area, and notified them of the issue. Michelle let me know the seat was known to be broken and could not be adjusted through the control panel due to a power failure. Any seat manipulation would require it to be done manually by two flight attendants. I requested another seat due to seeing a couple available, and she informed me they were for the cabin crew. So, I let her know I needed to figure something out due to my seat being broken. She then requested another attendant to help her manually move the seat, and after attempting this, the seat jammed and was left pushed forward with the seat back leaning forward, as well. For the entire duration of the flight, 10+hours, I was unable to sit upright, recline, nor was I able to use any electronic functionality of my seat. Furthermore, due to the seat being stuck leaning forward, the tray table to eat was also unable to be opened, so I had an issue with dining. Michelle realized this was an issue and contacted American Airlines Customer Relations during the flight to request they reach out to me about this ordeal. Michelle let me know that AA knows about damaged seats and plane issues but were opting to wait for major renovations to their fleet in October. I questioned why they would sell a premium seat knowing the seat was damaged, and she told me it is a known frustration throughout multiple flight attendants. No matter what, American will not refund my money.

I was seated in the emergency exit row at seat 17A. The crew only asked the passengers sitting in the emergency exit rows for verbal confirmation that we would assist in evacuating passengers, although three of them were elderly. One of them had difficulty moving and appeared to be over 80 years old! I respect the elderly, but how can a person help in a real-life emergency if they cannot respond quickly? The emergency exits were cluttered with passengers’ hand luggage, and none of the crew asked to place it in the overhead compartments, which had enough space available. On the next flight, all 12 seats in the emergency exit row were empty, which contradicts safety regulations. In the event of an emergency, there would be no passengers who were briefed and responsible for opening the emergency exits. This would hinder an effective evacuation of the passengers.

4452,4452,American Airlines,2,"""this layover was too short"" ",6th October 2024,True,"   I booked a flight from Colombia to Washington State with American Airlines, which included an 11-hour journey with a 1-hour and 35-minute layover in Miami. Unfortunately, this was insufficient time for customs, and I arrived just as the gate was closing. American Airlines should have known that Miami was a busy airport and that this layover was too short for a smooth connection. When I arrived, they directed me to their ""rebooking counter."" I had never encountered such a counter before, but it turns out they have at least two, staffed by 4-5 employees, likely due to frequent rebookings. There was even a sign indicating that they often overbook flights. They managed to book me on a flight the next morning that would stop in Dallas, arriving in Seattle at 3 PM the following day. When I asked to speak with the manager, she was dismissive and told me that they were only legally obligated to provide a layover of between 90 minutes and 2 hours. She added that if I had been flying to Canada or the UK, they would have had to provide hotel accommodations and meals, but because my final destination was within the U.S., they had no obligation to assist me. She insisted I should feel fortunate to be rebooked at all. This led to a long night spent at Miami airport. The next morning, my flight to Dallas was delayed on the tarmac for over two hours because one of the engines wouldn't start, necessitating a mechanic's intervention. As a result, I arrived in Dallas 15 minutes after my connecting flight had left. I had to return to the rebooking counter yet again, where I finally secured a new flight for 5 PM.

Lauderdale. He was traveling alone with his hockey equipment (bag with gear and hockey sticks all properly packed). He arrived around 1 pm in FLL and immediately checked his gear. All outside bags looked in tack. He briefly checked his sticks (bottom to center) that were in separate travel bags and all looked good but never took them completely out of the bag to fully inspect the inside content. Again the outside of the bag looked fine. That evening (7 PM) as we were preparing to go to the rink and he was getting his gear together he wanted to retape his sticks (3 of them) and when he removed them from the bag all three sticks were broken on the top of the sticks. We immediately called the customer service line and waited well over an hour for a call back only to be then pushed to another representative and have to wait another 45 minutes to speak to someone. At this point, it was well over 11 pm when the customer service representative told us we had to return to the airport so baggage claim could assess the damage. We had 24 hours to file our claim at this point in the evening we only had about an hour to return to the airport and were exhausted from travel and the stress of the damage. So we woke up the next morning at 5:45 am to travel back to the airport. We were at the office at 6:30 am when they opened and no one was there. Waited about 30 minutes for someone to finally arrive and was the least bit helpful or caring. She had us scan a QR code and fill out our claim. This claim only allowed us to take (1) picture which did not give a full assessment of the damage made to all three of his sticks. Let us note that two of the sticks were custom and the total value of all three is about $1,000! After filing the claim the rep at the airport sent us on our way and said we had to wait for a response. We were greeted with a denied claim a few hours later. I again called the customer service line to see if I could get further details as to why this was denied. They broke the sticks in transit and were little to NO HELP at all but to no avail to get a human on the line to assist us let alone an email where we could atleast reach out to someone else. We also reached out to customer service via ""X"" (Twitter) and we got the same customer service line and resent all the pictures of the damage to later get a message via DM that the claim was also denied. I will never fly American Airlines again and strongly suggest anyone traveling with sports equipment or equipment of significant value to stay clear from this airline!

I even like how they even set up a warning about safety concerns for turbulence impact, reminding to wear your seatbelt and PA announcements on the mini TV screen.

At check-in they inspected it, put stickers on it and told me to take it with me on board the plane. I asked if it was extra luggage for me, I was ready to pay for it. The girl at the check-in replied that no. I asked again, is it sure to take it with me on board the airplane? The check-in girl said yes. I don't fly much, especially as I thought the staff should know better, so I listened. All in all, when checking my hand luggage, the skateboard was taken away from me by the airport staff. They didn't explain anything, just said ""Problem"", and the most I got: they took me to the AnadoluJet window. Actually, everything could have been solved at this point. After all, the flight was 2 hours away. Check-in was still open, a representative of the company could have taken the skateboard from security and handed it over to the luggage compartment at check-in. But alas! The man from Anadolu Jet without asking took away passports and tickets from everyone who was near the window. When I tried to explain my situation, I got only a dry nod in response, nobody listened to me. Then he explained something to the passengers for a long time in Turkish. Finally he said that we had to go with a man to get our luggage and then we would have our tickets changed if we didn't make the flight. He was asked, ""Will your company exchange the tickets for free?"". He said: ""Yes."" In the baggage area, no one spoke English from the staff (in an international airport on an international flight). I waited a very long time for my luggage, they didn't bring the longboard even though they promised. I had to walk around and communicate with airport security myself to have it returned. Next is the most interesting part. I go to the AnadoluJet window and ask to exchange the ticket. I am told the cost of the ticket is 16524 lira (about 550 euros)! I tried to find out why, in the end I got the employee's answer: ""You are late, it's your fault it was canceled"". Such a confident answer, although she didn't even know what the reason for the cancellation was. I tried to explain that it wasn't my fault that it was canceled, that at check-in their employee told me to take my skateboard on board, even though it was not allowed. And that another employee of their company said that the ticket exchange would be free. But the customer care service didn't care about that. The customer care service is terrible! In the end I took a ticket from another company, which cost 200 euros instead of 550 and there was no problem with the skateboard at all!",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/IMG_20231105_144250-500x500.jpg,Boeing 738,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Istanbul to Cologne,October 2023,,,,1.0,,,1.0,no,neutral,0.8059517741203308,6.310497283935547,plastic bag
4746,4746,Arajet,3,"""worst airline I have used""",4th June 2024,True,"  Arajet is the worst airline I have used. There was a man who took photos of my documents, passport and residence card with his personal cell phone. This has never happened to me with Air Transat or Air Canada. I don't think it's safe. He told me it was to send to the Santo Domingo team. I thought my problems were over when I finally boarded the plane, but it was only the beginning. The seats are stuck, no water is given. A bottle of water costs 2 US dollars. I bought a chicken and potato dish for 12 US dollars, but I couldn't eat it, it was not good. For my return, I had to return earlier than planned because my son was sick. I changed my ticket on the website and had to pay a fee of 270.88 Canadian dollars. I spent three days trying to pay on the website but couldn't. So I called customer service. When I called customer service, there was an agent who told me there was a problem with MasterCard. This is why payment cannot be made. Well, afterwards, I tried with a Visa card, but that too didn't work. I called again, and there was another agent who left me on the line alone for about 20 minutes, under the pretext that he was looking for a solution. Eventually, I found another person who informed me that payment issues often happen on the Arajet website. He advised me, as I was in Santo Domingo, to go directly to a Pagatodo office. Upon arriving at the Pagatodo office, I was informed that I had to pay in Dominican pesos. I was supposed to pay $270.88 Canadian, but was charged 16,250 Dominican pesos, which works out to about $375 Canadian. It's incredible ! It's theft, there is no coordination, they are amateurs, they are not serious. I do not recommend this airline at all.

I went with ginseng tea. The cabin attendants were friendly and polite in their service. The cabin manager introduced herself to each business class passenger prior to takeoff.

Being 6 hour night flights, I was also able to get a couple of hours sleep both ways. The flight attendants were courteous, but the service was rushed. The dining was disappointing. Dinner on the way out, but breakfast on the way back, at 11pm at night! Both were hurried, and did not see the crew until landing time when they came around with hot towels. On both flights, I requested a pre dinner aperitif, but it was served with the meal, the wine, the desert all on one tray (except the main course)! On my return flight I asked again for my pre dinner drink to be served before the meal, which was noted with a smile, but again came with everything on one tray. I don't know whether there was specific reason for this, as on the London route, food served was a proper dining experience. Still, the food was tasty, yet with only one item for desert.

I was welcomed with pre flight drinks including Champagne, followed by hot towel. Ten minutes after take off flight attendants came around taking drinks and dinner orders. The menu was - Western and Korean cuisine. I opted for the Bibimbap meal - a traditional meal of rice with accompaniments and soup, which was absolutely delicious. I am not too keen on sweets, so followed up with a cheeseboard. Later coffee and cognac. The service was unhurried, and well timed serving each course. A couple of hours before landing, a snack was served - actually quite substantial, again the attendants coming around to take your order. Super efficient, polite, yet not chatty or engaging. However, at the end of the flight I was asked if I enjoyed it, which nice little touch. My return flight was equally enjoyable. And in-between meals the flight attendants would come around asking if you wanted anything else such as drinks and snacks including noodle soup. The IFE was very limited, and although the movie selection was tiny, it did have a couple of the latest movies. The touch screen worked well. The Amenity Kit was OK but nothing special. Slippers were provided in pouches. My only slight complain was the actual seat. The controls were very easy to use. There was the standard seat belt plus shoulder strap (not sure the technical reason for this). It was comfortable for sitting, but quite hard for sleeping.

We were 2kg over on checkin which was quoted as going to cost 20pounds! We only had 3 carry-on bags (out of our limit of 4) and the plane wasn't full, so common sense would say just let it through. Instead we had to take the 2kg out and make a 4th carry-on bag. So the weight is still in our entitlement but what a pain! Then on arrival to Gatwick our brand new expensive Samsonsite suitcase had a huge gash on the front of it! I was shocked. There was no person at the baggage info desk at Gatwick (South Terminal). So when I got home and had a customer feedback email from Aurigny, I answered it straight away and told them about the problem. I got no response. I emailed Aurigny again after I returned home from my holiday only to be told: ""The online Survey that is sent out does not come from Customer Services. All claims have to come to this email address, and we have checked, and we definitely didn’t have any emails from you until yesterday.

Unfortunately we chose row 11. Row 11 does not recline. However, row 10 does. (Think about that before choosing a row 11 seat on this A320.) The designers did not take this into consideration when deciding on how much legroom to give the passengers seated in row 11. Apparently none of the economy seats recline (those are the ones beyond the 10th row). So rows 12 to 30 do not suffer from reduced legroom when the passengers in front of them recline their seats, because the passengers in front of them can’t recline their seats. Avianca does not serve a meal on this flight, we talking about an international flight, that takes off at 10 AM and lands at 2PM (as in: “lunchtime”). Sure, this is becoming a common theme with airlines, but most offer food for purchase. Avianca did offer some snacks and sandwiches for sale, but only stocked enough for the first 9 rows. By the time the attendants got their cart to the 11th row they were out of all the sandwiches and croissants. Keep in mind that this A320 has 30 rows… The movie and TV selections were very limited. I usually fly AA which by comparison offers a wide selection of entertainment. On this trip we connected with a United flight to Cleveland, which, even with a delay of 2 hours on the tarmac due to weather, was still more comfortable than our Avianca experience.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_0801-500x500.jpg,A320,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Medellin to Orlando,July 2024,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,,1.0,no,neutral,0.5324956774711609,5.669696807861328,printer

If you are willing to put up with a longer overall flight to Tel Aviv from NYC in exchange for a lower fare, Azerbaijan Airlines is a very good choice. The only downsides are no in-flight wifi and the entertainment selection could be more current. On the plus side, the 787 that they fly for the long haul to Baku does have individual USB ports to keep a phone charged so you could download a movie you want beforehand and watch it without your phone dying.

The meals were very good on both flights, although I had requested a vegetarian meal (out of slight preference rather than insistence) which was not available. While this was not a huge disadvantage for me personally, it will have been a problem for more resolute vegetarians. My main criticism is the lack of content on the entertainment system. The interface works very well, but there was no interesting material to watch/listen to.

The Embraer 190 has much better legroom than the 170 so look out for the type flying when booking. The blue leather seats and 2 - 2 layout make for comfort. Trip to London City on Oct 2 at 08:45 on the EMB190 was wholly smooth. Fantastic view of the three Forth bridges on departure. So much legroom and space, and I'm 6ft 1in & 19st. On time more or less, pleasant crew, and a free breakfast of bacon rolls or a platter of fruit salad and organic yoghurt. Water, and hot drinks. Just what was needed. LCY is so easy to get through in arrival and I was on the DLR to the city in 10 minutes flat. A great start to the day. Returning home on Oct 3 at the 14:40 on the smaller EMB170 was much less comfortable due to turbulence for at least 20mins thanks to the tail of a US hurricane passing over GB. The reassuring captain apologised several times and explained he was trying to get clearance to a higher level. Good to be kept informed. The crew were marvellous. Kind, cheerful, the best of BA. Drinks and snacks served despite the plane lurching about. All comp, including a good Glenlivet malt. Edinburgh arrival fine and into tram within 20 mins of touchdown. These jets aren't new and it does show a bit but it's a cut~above experience still compared to the alternatives.

Traveling to Rotterdam The Haque Airport is pretty doable by public transport from Rotterdam Central Station or The Hague Central Station by bus and/or underground. Once arrived, I went straight to check-in my luggage which was fast and efficient as there was literally no queuing time. After passing the usual struggle at security I had a hour left before boarding starts. Due to work in progress on Rotterdam's terminal, there wasn't much to do (wifi was fast and constant though with lots of seating areas). Boarding was done in a nice and efficient way, however what do you expect of only boarding approximately thirty people? The cabin was comfortable. Plenty of legroom, leather seats and a good view in front of the wing, however I'd like to note that it would have been better if they actually replaced their magazine and safety card by a new one as the current one was in a very very poor state. Departed on time, it was a pretty short and straight leg with the pilot informing us several times with departure, arrival and weather information and 15 minutes into flight, the flight attendants served us a pretty limited service for British Airways terms (might had to do with a short flight of only 55 minutes), which included a drink of choice and a biscuit or chips. Once arrived with a not so smooth landing, the plane was quickly parked and deboarding started within a few minutes. Walk to customs (in peak, this is terrible) and baggage drop-off was just a few minutes.

There's still complimentary catering in economy on flights to London City and this (for me) meant a beer and some crisps. I occasionally travel business class (Club Europe) on this route and the catering offered there is more substantial than that offered from Heathrow/Gatwick.

Upon arrival to check in bags, I was again informed that I was sitting in the exit row and verified that I understood and met the requirements. When boarding the plane, again, verified my seat and requirements. When I was about to step on the plane, a Bangkok air employee pulled me out of the line (in the tunnel) and demanded my boarding pass. With no explanation, they told me I had to change seats. My friend and I had booked seats together to which they took her boarding bass and scribbled out both our original seat numbers and given new seats at the very back of the plane. This was very embarrassing and with no explanation, we were now the last to board and unfortunately and to no fault of our own, held up the boarding process. We asked repeatedly why we were moved and given no reason. As we were about to land, finally we pulled an attendant and requested an explanation. We we told that I didn’t look like I could perform the requirements to sit in my original seat. I then proceeded to show that I was more than capable, to which the staff agreed. They then merely said if we were not happy to just, “email customer service if you aren’t happy.” Never acknowledged the inconvenience. Interesting that when this airline makes mistakes, the customer is placed in the least desirable seats on the plane. You would think they would attempt to improve your experience rather than make it even worse. Only use this airline if you have no other options.

This cabin crew was not just doing their job—they were truly caring for every passenger, making everyone feel like they were being treated with the utmost attention and respect. From the moment we boarded, the crew greeted each passenger with sincere smiles. Whether they were guiding us to our seats or answering questions, they were always patient and considerate, making everyone feel at ease. Despite the long flight, they maintained a cheerful and relaxed attitude, making the time pass much faster than expected. Throughout the flight, the crew’s service was even more impressive. During meal service, they paid close attention to each passenger’s needs and even proactively asked if anyone required additional assistance. What truly stood out was the crew’s high level of professionalism. As we prepared for landing, they didn’t rush to tidy up or prepare for descent. Instead, they walked around the cabin, gently reminding passengers to check for any forgotten personal items, ensuring nothing was left behind. This cabin crew, with their genuine smiles, attentive service, and professionalism, made this flight truly exceptional.

I initially booked my flight on the basis of the basic fare without luggage and thought that it was fairly reasonable for a no frills flight. However i needed to add luggage later on and saw that it was over £65 each way. This did not include seat selection or any other benefit so I saw online that you could upgrade your ticket to include luggage, seat selection and meals. I decided to do this as it seemed that it would offer more comfort and if i was going to pay so much extra for luggage, i may as well include the others. The meals had to be preordered but i did not get what i ordered. You had to pay separately for drinks other than water. The waiting time for check in was a disgrace and i was in a queue for approx 90 minutes on my return journey and only passed through security whilst the plane was boarding which meant a rush through the airport to catch my plane. This was very stressful and then the ""Premium"" upgrade i had paid for did not include any priority boarding or any such benefit. The flight left on time and landed in good time. However it took over 45 minutes until i could pick up my luggage despite a very short queue in passport control. The staff were polite but all in all, i thought it was a horrible experience which worked out very expensive. My flight to Cyprus in the end cost more than i have paid for some long haul flights to the USA and SE Asia at almost £400 with luggage and meals included.

Then again, the business model for Boutique relies on them being the only game in town for far-flung airports. My journey home from Boston began with a call from the ticket agent as I made my way to the airport. He pulls double duty as a gate agent of sorts and wanted me to call upon arrival. He then strongly implored me to bring my bag aboard. It was a chore to lug on and off the small aircraft but I managed. The interior of the aircraft was in good condition except for the carpeting, which could have used a cleaning. There are sodas and small water bottles aboard, as well as snack size bags of pretzels and the like. One of the pilots offered us some of these before we took off on the second leg. And a lesson I learned the hard way—the cup holders are not super deep so maybe don’t buy a large coffee or any other large unsealable beverage to take aboard, lest you wear some of it during takeoff. There was significant turbulence on our approaches, especially into Baltimore. Passengers can see straight ahead and through the cockpit window as the plane shakes with the runway in sight. I don’t get air sick but people who do might want to know that. I should stress, however, that I at no point felt unsafe. Boutique offers codeshare with United, through whom I booked this trip.

6233,6233,Boutique Air,2,"""This airline failed me""",25th November 2021,True," I had a departing flight for on 11/23 scheduled for 6pm to see my family for Thanksgiving. Just for context, this airline has two flights departing from my local airport each day: 12pm and 6pm. On 11/23, my 6pm was cancelled. I was assured that the next-day's flight would be highly unlikely to be cancelled, so I was rescheduled for the it: 11/24's, 6pm. The next day rolls around and I get a text at noon that this flight was also to be cancelled. Great, now I can't see my family for Thanksgiving. What baffles me is that on each of these days, both 12pm flights were not cancelled. The airline definitely knew in advanced that my 6pm would fall-through. Therefore, why was I not offered a seat on a 12pm? Especially on that second day - they had a customer who obviously would have faced a second cancellation in a row, yet it didn't cross anyone's mind to offer me a seat on the same-day's 12pm that was 'On Time'. They were professional about it. But customer service is their only saving grace considering they aren't competent enough to work out the logistics of how to reliably route flights. I know this because the reason I was told both of my flights were cancelled was because ""The plane got held up at another airport."" Yeah, that's right....not a serious maintenance, weather, or issue with the pilot. It was because a plane got held up and the pilot didn't have time to fly (as if they had another leg after that last 6pm flight for the day). This company needs to realize that people are depending on them for their travel plans - especially near the holidays. In the real world, airlines will depart at whatever time necessary to successfully get their passengers from A to B. These guys, however, don't take their company's mission seriously enough to follow through on that task. A little hiccup here and there? Flight cancelled. A parent of mine died. It was very important that I could be home with my family to spend our first Thanksgiving together in memory of her. This airline failed me. That's no longer going to happen. But at least I got a phone call from a customer service rep apologizing and offering a refund. This company is simply going to fail, because they focus less on how to coordinate flights professionally and instead spend that effort on how to apologize to customers professionally.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/IMG_8927-500x500.jpg,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Pensacola to Muscle Shoals,November 2021,3.0,2.0,,1.0,,,3.0,no,neutral,0.5476634502410889,6.769317150115967,website
6234,6234,Boutique Air,1,"""insanely unprofessional these people are""",29th October 2021,True,"  I cannot express how insanely unprofessional these people are.  I booked my flight a month in advance and, having been stranded at O'Hare before, I made sure to get there hours early to ensure there was no possibility I'd miss this flight. I got a boarding pass, but became suspicious when everyone else on the flight (there were only 8 passengers) was called to weigh carry-on luggage and I was not. When I asked at the gate, I was informed that the flight was full and there was a problem with my ticket, that for some reason, I was showing up as flying stand-by. Nope. The person at the counter repeatedly asked if I was ""with Dan"" or ""Dan's girlfriend."" When I said no, but asked how I could have been issued a boarding pass if the plane was full, I got a shrug. Refusing to give up my seat, the flight was continually delayed until hours later, they told us there were ""mechanical issues"" and then ""bad weather"" and that we should all plan to be back at 5:30 AM the next morning to depart. Of course, some people wanted refunds and some of us were out $250 for hotel rooms (Boutique says they'll reimburse up to $100, but that remains to be seen). The next morning, those of us who still wanted to fly were there at 5:30, but again, delayed - no communication from Boutique, just no one present at the gate. Finally, a staff person showed up around 8 AM and as inconvenienced passengers complained about the delay, one woman, who had not been scheduled to fly the night before, laughed and said, ""Well, it definitely won't leave without us. I have the pilot's coffee!"" Why is that relevant? Because a plane full of people were delayed for over 12 hours, paying for food and lodging in Chicago, because the pilot wanted his girlfriend on the flight. With a full plane, there wasn't room for her as a passenger on the manifest until the inconvenience persuaded some people to go with alternative transportation. Once we boarded the plane, she sat in the cockpit with him for the duration. Unbelievable. Never again. Which works, actually, because they no longer serve my local airport after their door opened on takeoff leaving Minneapolis earlier this year.

And even across the row, other people from behind unceremoniously moved for the business seats!!! The purser did not blink or blush and had even indicated to the stewardess that he found this quite antisocial! Answer, sorry, then you should have paid for more expensive seats and you have more space at the emergency exit (that is not entirely true!) On the return journey the drama was even greater and it is the first and last time ever that I flew with this airline!  En zelfs 1 ster is nog te veel! Seats geboekt op rij 1 (dachten we met de online foto/tekening te zien) 23 p.p heen en 23. Terug dus totaal 92 euro. Mijn man is 2m+ en ook best grof en een probleem met de knieën door een operatie in het verleden. Ikzelf heb oedeem aan mijn benen en vlieg met steun/compressie materiaal en dan is lang vliegen niet altijd fijn in 1 houdin te zitten. En ze moeten ook uit na een bepaald moment omdat die houding anders knelt en dan is strekken fijn. Let wel lopen zorgt ervoor dat de benen weer vollopen en terug zitten in die houding dus ook. Heenreis( dag ervoor een mededeling dat we waren omgeboekt. Meteen gemeld dat we dit niet netjes vonden want je laat ons eerst duurdere Seats betalen en vervolgens verdwijnen we een rij erachter voor 14 euro. Verschil is dus bijna 10. Pp. Een kleine 2 uur later krijgen we ineens mail wilt u business class Seats boeken met een tarief van 190!! Pp? Ik dacht nog huh hoe kan dit want op de tekening van stoel reservering heb ik die blijkt gemist?  Meteen contact gezocht en Brussel airlines verzekerde dat we GEEN wij voor ons hadden maar cabine en dat business apart was… Nou wat zullen die mensen die nu dus 190 euro betaald hebben genoten hebben van dit stukje extra service zeg!! 3 glazen champagne elk half uur de vraag alles naar wens? En met 1.65 lengte alle extra ruimte? Om vervolgens in 1 in dezelfde ruimte te zitten en naar dezelfde toilet te gaan en de Seats die we oorspronkelijk geboekt hadden dus NIET betrokken waren! En trokken er zelfs aan de overkant van de rij andere mensen van achter zonder pardon om de business Seats!!! De purser verblikte of bloosde niet en had zelfs bij de stewardess aangegeven dit behoorlijk asociaal te vinden! Antwoord, sorry dan had u maar duurdere stoelen moeten betalen en u heeft meer ruimte bij de nooduitgang( dat is dus niet geheel waar!) Op de terugreis was het drama zelfs nog veel groter en is het meteen de eerste en laatste keer ooit dat ik met deze maatschappij heb gevlogen!

6473,6473,Brussels Airlines,1,“lacks the most basic hygiene on board”,30th April 2024,True," Brussels Airlines lacks transparency: the flight was more than 3 hours late, however no communication via email or SMS message was sent. Brussels Airlines treats people like cattle: all people boarding a Brussels airlines flight in Lomé are pre-checked in and directed towards a crowded room, hours in advance, without access to restrooms and refreshments. To get out of this room, one has to pass again the whole security process, taking off the cloths and passing through line ups and a humiliating procedure. In addition, there is no more boarding by groups, instead everybody boards the plane together as a crowd. Brussels Airlines lacks the most basic hygiene on board: the plane was dirty beyond anything I have seen before, garbage and bread crumbles on the floor everywhere, pee on the seats (picture attached) and the table dirty and sticky. When my wife asked for a disinfectant wipe, the crew lady didn’t even answer her. It took 15 minutes and asking twice to get almost throwed one at her, with an aggressive attitude. Brussels Airlines flight attendants are lacking the most basic professionalism and customer service skills, are abusive, random, bully and discriminatory towards the passengers: a culture of impunity seems to dominate Brussels Airlines crews, proved by the lack of any surveys after flights and by the difficulty of finding how to send a formal complaint. In addition, they refuse to show their badge with their name or give you any indicator that may identify them to the airline management. During this flight, I was seated in Economy Premium section, which was three mostly empty. As a result, multiple passengers from the economy section came to seat there and the crew just closed their eyes to this self-reclassification. Since my wife was sick, after diner she came to sit with me for a couple of hours, until I was awakened by two female flight attendants, one dressed in black and the other one in red, yelling at my wife to return to her seat. The comments and the tone of the voice were completely hysterical. I tried to explain that she is sick, and she is just siting there such as multiple other people around without a premium economy ticket did. I asked them to identify themselves and if a doctor was on board. They continued yelling and ignored my requests. She showed them her skin rash on her hands, probably prompted by the lack of hygiene on board. The two lady flight attendants became more aggressive, threatening her that they would bring her back to her seat by force. I asked how about the other people around that had also economy tickets and are seating in the premium section and I got a “none of your business” answer. Again, unlike the other 4 persons in the same situation as her, she just sat 3 hours in economy premium out of the 9 of the whole flight and did not enjoy food or any other privilege of premium economy. She just wanted to be comforted by me while being sick. What impacted me the most was the outrageous behavior of the two female flight attendants, the hate and discrimination they displayed towards my wife (the other 4 persons that sneaked in from the economy class were white male passengers), as well as the self-assurance that nothing can happen to them, no disciplinary action can be taken against them, whatever they do or say on board of the aircraft. Finally, ironically, just 10 minutes later, on the seat vacated by my wife came to seat another passenger from the economy class and he was allowed.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/dirty-seat-500x500.jpg,A330-300,Business,Premium Economy,Lome to Brussels,April 2024,2.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,negative,0.8253885507583618,7.5770955085754395,seat belt

6511,6511,Brussels Airlines,2,"""like a bad low-cost airline""",21st April 2023,True," This is European Business Class further in decline. My flights were from Heathrow to Tenerife via Brussels. While I checked in quickly, the boarding was a mess. There was a sign indicating priority boarding, but once announced, no attempt was made to navigate the economy passengers from the premium passengers queues. This meant a scramble with everybody rushing to board, which also meant delays. This happened on three of the four flights I took. Once on board, I noticed there was no curtain separation between the two cabins. Instead a small card with the sign 'Economy' was stuck onto the third row seat indicating that it was economy class beyond that. It was so cheap and shoddy. The seating has a paltry 29-inch pitch, with the middle seat empty - standard European configuration. After a long wait, we took off to Brussels, and a small unappetizing snack was served, with hot beverages in paper cups, and alcoholic drinks in a glass. The same routine followed on my return from Brussels to London. On the flights between Brussels and Tenerife, which were four hours and fifteen minutes, a hot meal was served both ways. One was overcooked pasta, and the other was a piece of chicken with mashed peas. Both were unappetizing. The wooden disposable cutlery made it difficult to cut the tough chicken. The only thing I enjoyed was the two pieces of Neuhaus Belgian chocolate presented in a little box. There were no refills for drinks offered and had to wait a long time for the trays to be cleared as the crew were busy selling food in the economy section. No smiles or any crew engaging with the passengers whatsoever, as they simply 'dumped' the little tray of food on us. Several of us in 'business' class had to use the call button to get a drinks refill - it was pathetic. This was like a bad low-cost airline with a tasteless meal thrown in. All four flights were delayed from 45 minutes to up to two hours.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Brussels-Airlines-Business-Class-A320-800-500x500.jpg,A320,Business,Business Class,London to Tenerife via Brussels,April 2023,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,negative,0.8290767073631287,4.6222100257873535,seat belt

In Brussels our flight was delayed for 3 hours, during that time we were bounced around between multiple gates with no updates being given unless asked. Finally, when we were able to board it was exactly 3 hours past our departure time, entertainment system didn't work, plane was not owned by Brussels Airlines and it was filthy. Landing to make our connection in IAD, which was already made very close because of the delay, we were held in the baggage hall for 4 hours waiting on our luggage due to Brussels Airlines saying we couldn’t leave? No clarification at all, just that we couldn’t leave without taking our luggage through customs. After 4 hours, no luggage, there was suddenly no issue with us leaving without our luggage? We ran to the gate of our connection on United which was booked with Brussels Airlines, flight had left, went to United customer service, they were no help at all and kept blaming everything on Brussels Airlines, so we had to sort out our own solution, ended up having to fly into ATL and get someone to drive 6 hours round trip to pick us up, the next morning!

Unfortunately the cutlery on Brussels Airlines flights is nowadays bamboo cutlery which doesn’t give a pleasant feeling when eating. Why can’t they serve meals with metal cutlery in business class as other airlines do. They serve champagne in business class; a cheap one (Duval Leroy) but luckily one that tastes quite well.

Entebbe Airport handled the necessary covid documentation efficiently and the lounge was relaxing. Boarding was efficient and passengers were greeted by a smiling and chatty cabin crew. This was a night flight and one of the essential requirements is that the meal is dealt with as quickly as possible so that passengers can sleep. The cabin crew were faultless and within a short time of taking off we were being offered a choice between marinated beef or Nile perch sausage as a starter and chicken breast, cold with salmon or basil pasta as the main course. I opted for the fish and a rather pleasant Château de la Grave Bordeaux, preceded by a glass of Duval-Leroy champagne glass of Croft port at the end. This ensured four hours of sleep on a comfortable flatbed seat. The objective of any flight is to get from A to B – the reason for going business is to enjoy some cost-effective luxury and Brussels Airlines excelled at both.

6556,6556,Brussels Airlines,1,"""This was one of the best flights""",23rd May 2021,True,"  I have never been on a flight and thought that the airline had got it absolutely right but on this occasion it came very close. Business passengers were allowed on first and there was a separate line. Documentation (visa and covid) had been checked already. The aircraft had very new seats and having done my research knew which the best ones were – even numbers on the right-hand side – which were window seats with aisle access. There are a number of aspects to the seat design which stood out. Although they appeared slightly unusual at first the designers have got it right. The table slid out easily from the left-hand side; there are two very convenient storage areas to the left and in front; the seat has numerous options and was easy to control; and the 4K screen was beautiful and was positioned exactly right – not too close and not too far. The attitude of the cabin crew was brilliant. They were efficient, smart and attentive but not too overbearing. It would have been nice to have been given a drink before takeoff although the seats all had a water bottle. Meal service was done by giving a choice of two dishes as it was served and all the options looked good. I opted for the smoked duck breast, meatloaf tenderloin and cheese. The wine selection was slightly limited because of the pandemic (something common with most airlines but they served an excellent French red followed by port. Being Belgium’s national airline there was a nice selection of beers – I tried the Tripel Karmeliet which was excellent. Leaving the aircraft was done efficiently and one of the advantages of operating under covid rules is that leaving is done strictly by row and so there was no mad rush to get off or a race to reach immigration first.

Caribbean Airlines differed my ticket to a later date, at no cost. When I was ready to fly in May 2022, the call centre was able to rebook quite simply. I used the opportunity to upgrade my ticket to Business Class which the agent did over the phone, simple transaction. I use the APP for all my Flight Management with regard to seats, meal requests etc.. BW600/26JUN POS/YYZ operated on-time. It was my first time using the new B737 MAX8 and was really impressed with the comfort of the cabin. The ergonomics of the seat made for a super comfortable 6hr flight. The IFE is a big improvement on this aircraft and the aesthetic of the cabin is also very mod looking. Once of the highlights of this flight was the ability to pre-order a meal. In this case, it was the Stewed Chicken with Macaroni Pie, Callaloo, Fried Plantain. A full on Sunday lunch on a Thursday night, LOL. Food was a generous amount and very tasty. Upon arrival in YYZ, I was expecting delays exiting the aircraft and getting thru Immigration and Customs. News of lengthy delays preceded my trip, but, it was actually very easy. BW607/09JUN YYZ/POS via GEO. Another on-time departure, early in fact. I opted for this flight via GEO because I preferred a daytime flight vs the red-eye which operates non-stop YYZ/POS, no regrets. Had a nice late breakfast in the lounge at Pearson and then a another delicious pre-ordered meal as we took off towards Guyana. This time, I ordered the Curry Chicken (or Chicken Curry) with Dhal and Rice. It was also a very generous amount and very tasty. Great flight down into the Southern Caribbean. The crew: On both flights, my cabin crew were amazing. They really do stand out from crews on other airlines in my opinion. They are warm and compassionate and their service is graceful. Extremely professional. Overall, my trip with Caribbean Airlines exceeded expectations and look forward to flying with them again soon.

Strangely though while spirits were readily available wine and beer were on request which I found a little odd. Boarding was a free for all with passengers ignoring the boarding staff completely much to the annoyance of the gate staff. Upon boarding the plane was amazed to be on a wide bodied 767 which I didn't know flew this route. We were in 2J and 2K and having experienced a slightly cramped 737 flight on the outward leg were delighted with the idea of flat beds and tons of leg room. The flight departed on time and the jovial captain detailed our route. About 20 minutes into service drinks and nuts were served including a perfectly chilled Moët and Chandon before dinner service We had preselected our meals, and our thoughts that Carribean serve some of the best inflight meals we have ever tasted were confirmed with a superbly spicy Thai Green Chicken Curry for me, and a equally nice Thai Green Tofu Curry for my partner which were served after salads and bread. Salmon and a Beef Pepperpot were also available. Impressive meals that were this months signature dishes, Sadly my seat didn't work much so had little chance to enjoy the flat bed, however my partners worked fine. Inflight entertainment was equally limited to 5 channels which did work in some seats and didn't work in others which was disappointing. However the legroom and comfort was far superior obviously to the outward journey. Service was polite and understated which I liked, from a pleasant crew, and we landed on time in JFK.

6928,6928,Cathay Pacific Airways,1,"""approach to handling claims is frustrating""",27th February 2025,True,"   I am posting this on behalf of my traveling companion, who experienced Cathay Pacific’s baggage claim process. Their approach to handling claims is frustrating, lacks transparency, and shifts responsibility onto passengers. On January 27, 2025, she flew on CX561 from Osaka Kansai to Hong Kong and discovered that her checked baggage was damaged upon arrival. Due to traveling with children, she was unable to report it immediately at the airport but submitted her claim within CX’s 7-day policy window.  Initially, CX refused to acknowledge the claim, stating it should have been reported at the airport. After multiple follow-ups, they finally accepted it but continued to delay resolution. They insisted on a purchase receipt, despite the luggage being a trade-in with no direct receipt available. CX based their offer on a depreciated “trade-in” value instead of a fair replacement cost. Depreciation was applied without explanation, and CX failed to clarify their calculation method.  It appears CX lowballs compensation offers, hoping passengers will accept without question. When my companion first submitted the claim, no ID or Letter of Authorization (LOA) was required—which made sense, since she was handling it personally.  However, after I followed up on her behalf, CX suddenly required an LOA and ID—but only after I requested an escalation. Instead of fairly assessing the claim, CX made the passenger do all the work. CX should have its own reference pricing for standard luggage brands instead of making customers research on their own. Despite multiple attempts to settle this fairly, CX has failed to provide a transparent resolution.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_3461-3-500x500.jpeg,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kanai to Hong Kong,January 2025,,,,,,,2.0,no,negative,0.8194842338562012,6.210194110870361,radiator

6962,6962,Cathay Pacific Airways,1,"""forced to purchase a new return ticket""",7th May 2024,True,"  I had an incredibly frustrating experience traveling from Singapore to Hong Kong with Cathay Pacific, which turned out to be the worst experience I've ever had. Firstly, Cathay has no ground staff support for customers needing to change or rebook flights at Hong Kong and Singapore airports. When I missed my flight from Singapore to Hong Kong, the ground staff redirected me to the customer call center, adding to the frustration. To make matters worse, they provided me with the wrong contact number, forcing me to hunt for the correct one. The customer center's assistance was lackluster, providing little essential information and prompting me to purchase new tickets online in a rush, following their instructions.  I usually choose full-service carriers and pay premium prices directly on their official websites expecting better support during unexpected situations. However, with Cathay, that expectation was shattered, leaving me to handle everything as if I were flying budget. Additionally, during my attempts to change my flight, I wasn't provided with accurate information by Cathay. I was blindsided by the cancellation of my return ticket from Hong Kong to Singapore. Despite my intentions to rebook clearly communicated to the customer center, they failed to inform me of the cancellation or take any proactive measures. I received no notification via email or phone call regarding this significant change. Discovering my canceled ticket upon arriving at the airport left me helpless, with no ground staff available to assist and another call to the customer center proving unfruitful. I was forced to purchase a new return ticket at an exorbitant last-minute price. Cathay should have retained my return ticket given my clear communication and willingness to pay the hefty last-minute fees, or notified me of the cancellation promptly. Instead, the whole experience felt like dealing with impersonal automated systems.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/image_67194881-500x500.jpg,A350-900,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Hong Kong to Singapore ,May 2024,3.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,no,negative,0.8964059352874756,5.334002494812012,hand-held computer

EVA operates an A330 with 2-2-2 in business class on this route but China Airlines operates an A350-900 with a 1-2-1 and what a stunning cabin this is probably the nicest business class cabin I have travelled. With a late departure around 2250 from Brisbane and an arrival into Taipei at 0545 the next morning with just under 9 hours in the air the quick meal service on departure was well organized and excellent quality which left a reasonable amount of time for some sleep before breakfast before arrival in Taipei.

I was even taken aback by pajamas being an amenity that was offered. There was free wifi too albeit slow. I have a couple of very minor gripes though. First, is my dislike for the slanted seating arrangment which obstructs the feet when in the lie flat position. Next, had to do with their website which is barely functional. I also would of liked a few more film offerings. Nevertheless, I arrived well rested and well fed, so ended up with a completely different outlook of China Eastern for the positive.

Sat in bulkhead row with briefcase etc by my feet, and nobody applied the expected safety rules to stow them for take off and landing. Meal box passed to me after boarding, in complete silence.

This is where my compliments end. Frankly, I don't really recommend China Eastern unless you don't have any other choice. With being conservative with my criticisms, I'd say its a barely mediocre airline at best. Moreover, MU is really an airline tailored for Chinese people. I based this on the language skills of the crew, food options they serve, and the limited availability of international film choices from their AVOD. The stewardesses kept speaking Chinese to me despite asking to not have Chinese spoken to me since I don't speak it. Additionally, one word for the AVOD system: boring. I flew on the newest A350 and there were only like a dozen movies on offer where most of the choices happened to be Chinese movies. As for the food, it was the worst airline meal I've ever eaten. Ordered a special LFML and the chicken that was served was the stalest and driest chicken to ever enter my mouth causing me to nearly choke. Also, ordering the special meal was a mission as I had to physically go to the airline office while on holiday since there was no way to do so online or over the phone. My advice is, don't fly this airline unless its really cheap and if you do, come prepared with your own snacks, entertainment, etc.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/6b3f8398-967d-442b-aa49-b2ce1255824c-500x500.jpg,A350,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Singapore to Busan via Shanghai,October 2023,3.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,no,neutral,0.4765034019947052,6.782788276672363,burrito

No one really bothered if there is still something left for the passengers. All the guests were very quiet but the lady working there and her friends were the most noisy ones.

You won't hear from the pilot at all. If you have a layover with this airline in Asia you will be routed through Shanghai Pudong, a terrible airport with three security checks, passport control and a feeling that you're selling your soul for a discount flight. Food is mediocre. Online entertainment consists of a handful of heavily censored vanilla Hollywood flicks. Expect half of the passengers to stand up the minute the landing gear hits the ground, sparking a very loud shouting match in Chinese Mandarin between the hostesses and unruly passengers to put a nice finishing touch to your experience.

I am a physician, normally fly at least 1-2 times/year, for volunteer medical/surgical mission work. I used China Eastern airline for the first time, flying out Jan 30. I had problem at the airport when checking in, which never before in my traveling experience. My passport has printed out my first and middle name in short and not spelled out in full as in ticket. I showed 3 different government issued IDs to identify myself. The counter agent would not issue me a boarding pass and insisted that my traveling agent change my ticket name. When I called the traveling agent, they would take 2 days, and advised me to ask the airline agent at the airport to do that for me. However, the airport agent and her supervisor refused to help me at all. They were extremely rude to me, literally man-handled me to step aside so they can help other customer. I stood there for over 1 hr. Finally, I asked my traveling agent to book me with the different airline at the same day or tomorrow flight. When I asked the supervisor to do in writing that they refused to issue me my boarding pass and the reason, she came out later and told me that she can now help me correct the name on ticket to be exactly same as the passport. The aircraft was quite old, not a lot of comforting equipment. WiFi was not working, and when asked the flight attendant, she said will let me know when function return, but she never told me for the rest of 14 hr flight. Flight attendant never once ask what I need during the entire flight, I had to press call button and wait for 30 min each time I need something. In conclusion, the service was worst than economy class, despite being business class. On the way returning from Bangkok, I did not have any problem at the counter at all, although took extra 15 min to check in due to my name on passport again. The food was also just tasted like coming from a vending machine. Even though the ticket in business class is $1,000 cheaper than other airline, I will never fly with China Eastern again. Furthermore, my brand new luggage was completely destroyed",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/20190130_144958-e1558628903329-500x500.jpg,,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Chicago to Bangkok via Shanghai,January 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,neutral,0.671052098274231,5.510336875915527,automated teller machine

7378,7378,China Southern Airlines,1,"""no complaints about the experience""",7th August 2024,True,"   CZ operates a diverse fleet of aircraft, from narrowbodies like the Boeing 737 and the A320, to widebodies like the Boeing 777 and 787, along with the A330 and A350, and I was eager to try out their post-Covid service. When I first flew with them 20 years ago, the standards were appalling but the country has made massive progress since then, and so has their airlines. The chance came when I managed to snag a bargain for a one-way ticket from Shanghai to Bangkok via CZ's Guangzhou hub for a mere USD 110 including all taxes and surcharges despite just booking it a week prior, and along with that came a chance to try out the experience on their older A330 widebody as well as their newer A350 widebody aircraft. They definitely left quite an impression, beginning from a smooth and efficient check-in experience, as well as a systematic boarding process. Within the aircraft itself, the cabin space provided sufficient and reasonable seat pitch (legroom) together with an engaging and modern IFE system available in multiple languages (A350 but not quite the A330). The food by the way was rather tasty as well and made for a decent meal. The cabin crew were professional and courteous, always smiling, and were superb in keeping the passengers well looked after. Announcements were made in both Mandarin and English, and apart from the accent the English was perfectly comprehensible. Above all, both flights departed and arrived safely and on time with no delays. If there was some room for improvement, that would be the booking and check-in process, as their website and mobile app still seems rather rudimentary and dated. Along with that, digital boarding passes were only available on certain sectors and done as a print-screen rather than being added to the mobile digital wallet. The queue at the check-in counter seemed rather intimidating at the start, but it moved along quickly. If the company is able to address these small teething inconveniences, it can potentially make CZ one of the best in the world. After all, the devil is always in the details. But at such a price point, there can be absolutely no complaints about the experience.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/cz-a350-cabin-500x500.jpg,A350-900 / A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Shanghai to Bangkok via Guangzhou,July 2024,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,,5.0,yes,positive,0.8259677886962891,5.976446151733398,high-speed train

She told me to walk to the international counters at gate 80-90.  I noticed that I was on seat 18F. I got there and noticed there were 3 queues, 2 for Penang 9.55 am, 1 for KL. All 3 queues were not that long, and it took me 50 minutes to check in because the staff serving my counter took a long time to check in a family of 10. I get that it is a big group, but 50 minutes? Both the Penang queues weren’t moving. My flight was at 9.55 am, and at 9.05 am I was still queuing behind the same family.  Eventually, at 9.10 am Penang passengers started jumping queues because it was so slow. They didn’t have an automatic ticket kiosk to check in passengers without bags. By the time she was done, I had to run to my gate. There was still a line to pass through immigration. I was on seat 30F because I was one of the last to check in again.

The seats on this little Avro are very cramped. Cityjet uses a 3-3 configuration instead of the standard 3-2. This makes the seats very thin, and leaves you with not much room. The inflight catering was provided by Aer Lingus, and featured a buy on board service. As this was a morning flight, I opted for a Hot chocolate and some shortbread, and for £4.50, this was decently priced. But the highlight of this flight was well and truly the Avro RJ85, which I wanted to fly on before they all get retired, and I am very pleased I did.

Note: It's a 5-7 minute drive, and there is a Coastal shuttle that runs between them. Only a couple of minor flaws: The air conditioning did not appear to be working on one of the planes while we were on the ground, so it was very hot.

They said they have no control what type of seats their Lufthansa partner assigns & I must take this w/ Lufthansa. Told them I did not choose Lufthansa & did not buy my tickets from Lufthansa but Condor did & they falsely advertised a full Business-Class seat. Condor refused to help. I Contacted Lufthansa & was told Condor only books economy w/ them & I will have to pay additional fee to get Business seats for remaining part of trip. I paid Lufthansa additional $640 for mine & my daughter’s seats. Upon checking in at the LAX Condor counter, I mentioned additional fee I had to pay to upgrade 2nd portion of my flight. I said I had to pay twice for Business seat from Frankfurt to Barcelona (& returning flight). Agent said to file a complaint with Condor to get reimbursed for paying twice for Business seats. I filed a complaint; Condor rejected. My LA to Frankfurt Business seat did not recline, making it less comfortable than Economy seat that reclines to some degree. I had to seat at an upright position. They offered $100 coupon to purchase one of few items offered on their inflight magazine! A Business class ticket costs 3X Economy; my seat was less comfortable than Economy seat. Flight attendant told me their planes are outdated, missing much needed maintenance, Condor won't spend money on making repairs on their old planes. She said they routinely apologize to passengers & are embarrassed by the condition of their planes.

Condor employee inspected the suitcase & confirmed the damage; Condor claim system generated a claim #. I was told I will be contacted for assistance, but never did.  I filed complaint at Condor website; got rejected. Questionable practice at website complaint process is that to complete the complaint process passengers must include their bank international code, routing number, account number. They do this to intimidate people from submitting complaints as it is impossible to complete their process before sharing this highly sensitive information. I don’t know if this is a legal practice in the US. I understand they may need this information if they choose to reimburse a passenger. But why would they ask for this information before even reading one’s complaint to decide whether to honor the complaint.

I booked Premium Economy and then paid $50 on my personal credit card for my seat. The ticket itself was paid for by my company, I had to pay for the seat with my personal credit card. Then, 3 days before the flight, Condor changed planes and the new plane didn't have Premium Economy. Not sold out, but the new plane didn't have those seats at all and no refund for the $50 for my seat selection. My wife was traveling with me, she purchased her ticket directly from Condor, and no seat even though she paid $50 as well. My wife is vegan and selected a vegan meal. But  we are now on the plane in economy, and no vegan meal for her. She is allergic to dairy so her Vegan meal is not a choice, but a medical condition. Her ticket says Vegan meal, when she signs on to the app it says Vegan Meal, but when the Attendant looks at her list, there is no Vegan Meal. The attendant says ""it must have been lost because your seat was changed from Premium to Economy"". She brings my wife a banana for a 10 hour flight. Economy is the absolute smallest seat I have even flown. We flew on KLM's Cityhopper later on our trip which is an Embraer 190. Tiny plane with only 2 rows on each side. We had more legroom on a commuter plane than on Condor Economy. Inches more. I am 5 ft 11 inches and I have shared a photo of the legroom on Condor. My knees touched the back of the seat in front of me.  Condor refunds us the difference between Premium Economy and Economy. But not for the seat selection.  So, we are out $100. About the only positive thing I can say is they didn't lose our checked bags. Really low bar. Just don't. Just don't fly Condor.

Never again will I fly with them, or at least not long distance. Our flight from Frankfurt to Cape Town was 12 hours, and never before have a had less comfort on a flight. I am 1,78cm tall and could not sit normally as my knees were stuck between the seats. They have cut every corner to make it a budget airline even though their prices are very high. Their economy premium is what other airlines have as normal economy. No food options you get what there is, which has no taste (ok airline food is usually not great but this was bad). Soft drinks are free, other drinks you need to pay for. Lights out at 0:30 so no sleep before that. And around 12 they hold a commercial on every screen for duty free shopping, very annoying. Still have to fly back with them unfortunately.

No screens, no wi-fi, no stowage room in front of me, and the stewards are inattentive at best. I can't believe I paid $1,500 for this filthy seat.

7847,7847,Copa Airlines,8,“flight was satisfactory”,19th October 2023,True," Flew back from a trip to Colombia on COPA and I do have to say there are pros and cons on traveling with this airline. On the first leg to Panama City I checked in at El Dorado and was at the gate within 30 minutes altogether. Because I purchased a basic economy ticket I had to pay to check in a bag but it was actually very cheap only thirty dollars. One thing I did not like was that you can’t buy alcohol at duty free if you travel through Panama City otherwise they’ll confíscate it or make you pay to check it in so I missed out on bringing back rum. Had I known that rule I would have bought it and put it in the checked in bad in Bogota. The flight itself was uneventful, the airplane had private TVs on each seat, flight attendants were normal not too friendly just basically did their job. in Panama City I went to duty free bought some booze which was given to me at the door. On this flight the crew were extremely attentive and very nice. There was a change of planes from a Max9 to 737-800 at the last minute. Headphones were handed out after take off, about an hour and a half into the flight dinner was served but there were no choices it was some kind of beef and beans with corn bread and a cake slice. For drinks no alcohol is offered not even to buy which sucks but they do have some really good guava and pineapple juice. There was another drink service after dinner and two water services after. In the galley they had Coca Cola, juice and drinks for passengers.

Check in at JFK was a breeze and the lady who helped me at the counter was very friendly. The first leg from JFK to PTY was on a 737 Max9 since we took off at 2 AM most people slept and there was no inflight service until about 3 hours into the flight when breakfast was served. They offered eggs or pancakes, believe it or not the food was very good actually. For drinks I had guava pineapple juice. You need to bring your own tablet or phone in order to watch movies and they have a wide selection of fils to see. Connecting in Panama City I had to walk to a different terminal. The airport itself is quite dull. The leg to Bogota was on a 737-800 which had screens on every seat. The crew didn’t hand out headphones since the flight was only an hour and 20 minutes. They provided some sticks and soda, juice team and coffee. Flight was quite smooth and crew was attentive but not overly friendly.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/IMG_6516-500x500.jpeg,Boeing 737 MAX 9 / 737-800,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Bogota via Panama City,October 2023,4.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes,neutral,0.4699275493621826,5.15694522857666,burrito

They only gave me 2 meal vouchers which I couldn't use because everything in the terminal was closed at that time (22h).

They alleged that my carry-on was over-sized, and that my duty-free was not a personal item. They threatened me with no letting me board my next flight and they confiscated my duty free even though other passengers offered to carry it for me. They also measured my luggage in the measurement box they have at the gate, and even though it fit in it and it complies with the requirements, they insisted I needed to check it. No one in the ground on in the aircraft offered any support and directed me to reach out to their customer service but didn't help resolve the incident. The duty free is still confiscated. However, senior administrative personnel from Copa airlines contacted me to process the return of my duty-free purchase. He apologized for the miss-treatment and indicated they will conduct some training as he saw the video captured by their own cameras at the gate and agreed that it has been disrespectful. Because of that I'm rating them with a 5. On my way back, while in line to the security check point at the gate, I was finishing the last sip of a bottle of water. The woman at the check point rudely yelled at me, and even though I politely responded, finished my water, threw the bottle in the respective can, she continued to rave. She went as far as to abruptly hiding her badge so I would not see her identification. when I retrieved my phone to take a photo her coworkers and her threatened me again with not letting me board the plane. I encouraged them to be aware of the cameras and told them I was already in touch with a customer person at Copa Airline given a similar behavior on my previous flight connecting through Tocumen as I was explaining, they decided to turn and walk away letting me stand alone as I was still speaking.

This was brand new LV bag. The emailed me back a few weeks later stating the would not cover the damaged “due to the fact that the damage presented may be due to inherent use or quality of the baggage.” This was a brand new LV bag, that I purchase a month prior to the trip.

Great and efficient customer service over the phone or by email.

Overall, among the better local services within the EU.

Upon entering and putting my carryon in the overhead compartment, I was having a bit of trouble. Shortly after a kind gentlemen came to assist and has he helped me push my bag up a walking stick came out of the compartment and fell to the ground. At that time I heard the flight attendant who was standing across a row of seats watching. She then said put the stick back when were done. As we continued to push the bag in another walking stick fell out but this time it hit me just a millimeter of an inch below my left eye. As the bag was in the compartment and I put the sticks back she then asked me if it hit me and my reply was it absolutely did. She then responded that's why you need to look. I can tell you that neither the man who assisted me or myself was able to see any walking sticks. She just stood there to make sure we put them back. Why was the walking sticks right in front of the bag it should have been positioned behind or on the side of it. I then realized that she must have assisted in placing them there. She never asked where I was hit or if I was ok, she never wrote up an incident report although I don't know the procedure on these matters but I would presume that it should have happened. She just proceeded with her tasks. As a result I had bruising under my eye. I contacted Delta to complain and their response was we can offer you a $150 compensation. My response was that the compensation does not equal the injury. I then filed a complaint with the FAA who then forwarded it to the DOT. I have had several back and forth emails on this matter and still they will not budge. I don't even know if they have questioned the flight attendant. Part of an email said and I quote ""We strive to provide amore positive experience the next time you fly with us"". Ordinarily I would not ever fly with them again but if they want to change my perspective on their airline then they should offer me a free airline ticket to wherever I want to go. What would it really cost them to offer me at least that especially where they may be empty seats on the trip. This email came from a DOT specialist. She was the last email I received and she offered me $150 voucher. SMH.

So, we returned and told the staff member that we needed to check in here since we were flying Business. His rude response: “You could have said that.” Well, it’s not our job to inform him—it’s his job to ask what class we’re flying. It didn’t get better from there. The check-in agent seemed completely uninterested and, at the end, simply stated a number while staring at us when we didn’t immediately understand what it meant. We had to figure out for ourselves that he was referring to the gate. The only positive experience was the lounge (which was a Lufthansa lounge, not a Discover one). Then came boarding. After scanning our tickets, we walked toward the aircraft, but the entrance to Business Class was still blocked because they weren’t ready. If they’re not ready, boarding shouldn’t start! There were passengers with mobility issues who had to stand and wait until they finally opened the section. The cabin crew was okay, but the welcome Prosecco was undrinkable.

I arrived the airport earlier with the hope that I will be able to get a replacement flight to Beijing. Seemingly that it was indeed risky for me to get a connecting flight from HKG to PEK on 1830. They offered me the option of next day departure which I agreed upon. Travelling was made easier as a confirmed seat and boarding pass for CX390 was also issued at the same time. Similarly, hotel was also arranged for me. Upon boarding flight KA060, I was assisted by the cabin crew to my seat. A apology was also made prior to departure informing the reason behind such delay. I am impressed with the professionalism of the flight attendants. In flight meal was promptly served after airborne. I had been flying Cathay Dragon since 2014. Nonetheless, I am slightly disappointed with the in-flight meal. The portion has now been re-sized to smaller portion since 2016. In the last 12 months I had also flown with other airline in this region.  Asiana Airlines still serve dessert and metal cutlery which Cathay Dragon now longer provide.

I booked the flight in good faith several weeks in advance to ensure I had a seat. At the Gate I was denied boarding as the plane “was overweight” and 2 passengers would have to be left behind. Despite remonstrating forcefully and explaining why it was so important to get to Leeds on that flight, Eastern Airways could not be moved. Eventually, the airport staff (whose behaviour was at all times sympathetic and polite) asked the other passengers who were waiting on the transit bus for a volunteer to give up their place, explaining the circumstances. Unfortunately, no one took pity on my plight and I was denied a place on the plane. I was left distraught and upset having missed an unrepeatable family event.

So actually, if you go early during this 20 seconds window of priority boarding, you end up waiting longer than economy. 4) The food is just some microwaved slime. 5) The seats are exactly the same as economy class on this flight.

I was travelling with two young children and the cabin crew were very attentive with us throughout the flight. They offered a kids pack with crayons and a a booklet with activities. The children breakfast was offered first and then to the rest of the passengers. Breakfast was very nice, with two types of cheese, and two types of ham, yogurt, fresh warm bread loafs were offered twice with a choice of white and brown bread. It felt like a business class service. During the 4 hour flight drinks were offered a number of times. The seating comfort was good (we were sitting in row 7). Seats had a decent recline whilst also leaving sufficient knee space. The seatbacks had a special small tray were passengers can install and attach their tablets.

8960,8960,Egyptair,1,"""common pattern delaying luggage""",17th August 2023,True," Surviving EgyptAir If you care about your mental well-being, safety, and belongings, then DO NOT EVER FLY WITH EGYPTAIR. My girlfriend and I flew with EgyptAir on Thursday 27th July 2023 from London to Accra (MS780 and MS881) with a layover in Cairo. When we landed in Accra the following day, our luggage did not appear on the conveyer belt. This was also the case for over fifty fellow passengers. We were told by Aviance Ghana staff members (the airline ground handling company at Accra Kotoka International Airport) that all the luggage had arrived and we would have to file a property irregularity report (PIR). EgyptAir’s website states that ""in the event that your checked bags do not arrive on your flight, EGYPTAIR will make reasonable efforts to ensure that the bag is returned to you within 24 hours."" However, this was not fulfilled as our checked baggage was not on the flight which arrived on Saturday 29th July 2023. As the majority of our two-week trip was scheduled to be in Kumasi, we headed to our destination and had someone check for our bags each day there was an incoming flight to Accra from Cairo (Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday). The email communication from EgyptAir is below par. It took over ten emails to get a response from the different email addresses I had messaged. The London email account was slightly helpful, but could not provide any information on where my bags were as they said the baggage email account had that information. Their social media pages copy and paste the same message, advising to contact the email the baggage team. The baggage team email did not respond until Tuesday 5th August 2023, despite having emailing them and other accounts since Sunday 30th July 2023. They had requested for our bag tags, yet they never responded to my email with the attached bag tags. I tried tracking the bags using my bag tag numbers on their app and it didn’t work. Even if you check on World Tracer it says “your airline is not supporting this service. Please contact the airline’s website for further information.” The bags eventually arrived on Monday 7th August 2023, but my girlfriend and I each had a bag damaged. We were offered temporary compensation by EgyptAir, equating to 100 USD in Ghana Cedis. Our experience with EgyptAir was not unique and they have a common pattern delaying and damaging passenger’s luggage. If you check tweets, countless people flying to destinations across Europe, Africa and America have had their bags lost, damaged or delayed. Even people in the queue waiting for the PIR in Accra said they frequently delay your bags because they have small aircrafts and only bring in luggage on big aircrafts. DO NOT FLY WITH EGYPTAIR. You are better off training to become a pilot, buying your own aircraft and flying to the destination yourself than having a pleasant experience in EgyptAir. Now battling to receive compensation from EgyptAir for delayed and damaged bags.

8970,8970,Egyptair,1,"""has zero regard for passenger comfort and well-being""",17th May 2023,True," The discomfort started aboard. The seating arrangement was cramped and uncomfortable, offering minimal legroom compared to that of other airlines. As if that weren't bad enough, the seats were worn-out, tattered, and reeked of an unpleasant odour. Furthermore, there were no air vents above the seats. It was clear that Egyptair has zero regard for passenger comfort and well-being. It all seemed like I had booked with a budget airline. The in-flight entertainment system was a joke. The screens were tiny and outdated, with a limited selection of movies and shows. To add insult to injury, the system malfunctioned, leaving me bored and unable to distract myself from the unending hours of discomfort. See the photo attached for reference. Now, let's talk about the abysmal quality of the food. I understand that airplane food is typically subpar, but Egyptair took it to a whole new level of awfulness. First, I was given a completely different meal (fish) than what I had ordered (beef). Then why bother even asking what I want? The food kept sliding off the low-quality table trays, so I had to eat single-handedly while holding the tray in place. The meals were tasteless, unappetizing, and resembled something one might find in a school cafeteria or a construction site. It was a struggle to stomach the barely edible slop that was served, and I would have gladly gone hungry if given the choice. Half of each meal was returned as is. I ordered sparkling water with my meal, which they did not have. I was given a coke instead. In-between meals I had not even been asked a single time if I wanted something to drink. To make matters worse, the flight attendants were extremely rude, racist, unhelpful, and indifferent to the needs of passengers. They seemed more interested in chatting amongst themselves than providing any form of customer service. There was no greeting or even the slightest smile when boarding. The same was the case when getting off the airplane. Requests for assistance from passengers around me were met with eye-rolls and sighs, leaving me feeling like a burden rather than a paying customer. It was clear to all that the staff did not feel like working. Impatience, anger, disrespect and disinterest are amongst others what characterized them all, without a single exception. I even witnessed two of the female staff members, who did not speak the language of the departure country and were far from fluent in English themselves, pressingly tapping random passengers on their shoulders following with: 'you, translate now!' Other times the output was: 'food, you', 'drink? Drink?'. Blatantly shouting by the flight attendants was common on this flight, even at the elderly. The people next to me were the sweetest but were treated so condescendingly due to the language barrier. It really broke my heart. In response to them asking if there maybe was a spot where one could pray, the flight attendant remarked 'Where? No, you must do it here', whilst rolling her eyes. Are you serious? The utter lack of any semblance of empathy and professionalism was mind-boggling. It baffles me how these incapable flight attendants are still working in this industry. If it weren't for them I wouldn't even have bothered to write this review at all. In conclusion, I cannot express my disappointment enough. I strongly advise anyone considering flying with Egyptair to think twice and explore other options.

After five long hours, one of the executive representatives of Egyptair mentioned to all of the passengers they were going to put up in a hotel because they couldn't find a spare tire for the aircraft. We waited another two hours for the bus transportation and hotel accommodations. The whole deal was horrifying with the transition of getting a new visa to enter back into the country. The business class lounge had no real accommodating, nourishing food. It was basically appetizers and finger food that couldn't hold our nurturing standers for the long hours.

9136,9136,Emirates,4,“Flying business now feels like economy”,18th January 2025,False," Wow! Ever since the the Aussie exec management left the airline, Emirates had been in a quality nose dive. It has gone from being a luxury carrier to being more like a low cost airline. Flying in business class now feels like economy used to be. Here is how the quality has collapsed IMO You no longer get an amenities bag unless you are overnight. The quality of the wine in business class has been reduced from nice Loire, South African or Aussie quality wines, to cheap plonk. Makes no sense. The quality of the food is utterly disgusting. I'm not kidding here. Check the photo of the business class vegetarian meal that I uploaded with this review. Twice they have served me this POW camp slop in business class. Defies all expectations. No accompaniments, no chutney, or sauces. Just brown slop in white rice. What I don't understand is why they are so gung-ho on cost cutting while passenger numbers and revenue are at an all time high. They are cutting their own throats because carriers like Qatar are still offering really great quality service. In fact (and I never thought I would think this) Saudia business class beats Emirates on food quality. (Actually, if you look at the photo of my business class meal, everyone beats that). Emirates customer service is now more concerned with revenue retention than with fulfilling the ticket terms, and can be quite combative. I have noticed that changing a ""Flex Plus"" ticket, despite being fully changeable always attracts a fare change, even when the original class of ticket if still available to buy in Emirates.com. I had such a fight with them I refunded the entire Flex Plus ticket and rebought the travel in my new date at the lower price I don't know what happening, I have a real soft spot for Emirates. At one time they set the bar for quality, but that's not true anymore and it makes me really sad.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PXL_20241217_130343926.MP_-500x500.jpg,A380,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Glasgow to Dubai ,January 2025,3.0,4.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,no,negative,0.8382843136787415,6.675532817840576,plate

The flight was initially delayed and we only boarded at 2pm. We then sat in the aircraft until just before 5pm until they eventually told us to disembark. We then went to baggage collection where most of us waited at least 2 hours for our luggage to arrive. I then waited in a line for another 1 and a half hours to book a new ticket. When booking the new ticket I then informed them my previous flight I had booked the vegan option as I've been strictly vegan for 5 years. They couldn't promise me anything but they said they'd try put the request in as I couldn't adjust it on my app with the flight being canceled. On the flight there were zero vegan options and all I could eat after 20+ hours of travel stress was black tea and some fruit pieces. Furthermore, my skyrewards number never works and I have been unable to accumulate points every time I fly.

9139,9139,Emirates,6,“Economy treated as an afterthought”,15th December 2024,True," As a frequent flyer with Emirates, I’ve always admired the airline's reputation for exceptional service, but my recent experience in Economy has left me deeply disheartened by the stark disparity in treatment between Business and Economy class passengers. Throughout the flight, it felt as though Economy passengers were treated as an afterthought. It took an excessive amount of time to receive any service, even something as simple as water, despite pressing the call button multiple times. On one occasion, I got up to stretch my legs and was approached by a flight attendant asking if I needed help. When I explained I was just trying to get some movement, I was told to return to my seat and wait for 10 minutes until service was completed. The tone and response felt dismissive and unnecessary. Another unsettling moment occurred when I pressed the service button. A flight attendant walked past me, nodded in acknowledgment, but didn’t stop. When she finally returned, she explained she had been “counting.” While I appreciate that tasks need to be completed, ignoring a passenger’s request and providing such a response felt dismissive and unprofessional. The final incident left me utterly shocked. While refilling my water bottle, another flight attendant accidentally spilled water all over my leg. Instead of a genuine apology or assistance, his response was, “I couldn’t see.” It’s difficult to understand how such carelessness and lack of attentiveness can happen on an airline that prides itself on excellence. As someone who has experienced the polished and attentive service in Business Class, the treatment in Economy was a glaring contrast. It felt as though Economy passengers were not afforded the basic courtesy or care expected from Emirates. While I understand there are differences in service levels between classes, this experience lacked the professionalism and warmth that should be standard across all cabins. I sincerely hope Emirates addresses these inconsistencies.

Used the SilverKris lounge which is good, boarding a bit disorganised but once onboard my seat 11A was comfortable enough. Flight departed on time for the 7 hour flight to Addis Ababa, service food (Dinner & Breakfast) and crew where okay. The PTV was also alright the seat not too bad, arriving Addis the transfer was straight forward and the airport itself wasn't too bad. I used the Cloud Nine Gold lounge which is a bit better than the general terminal, boarding the 2nd flight was again a bit of a mess. Another A350 and once again seat 11A however the seat had a fault so not too comfortable, crew where a bit vacant on this flight. The food a sandwich and lunch was again okay perhaps better than the first flight. Arrived CPT more or less on time after a flight of around 6 hours, bags delivered quickly so I suppose all in all Ethiopian got me from A to B & finally C without too much stress. I guess the one improvement would be the ground operation, it's pretty poor and rude at some points.

I had booked and paid for extra leg room seats (nearer the front of the aircraft) for both flights. Having 3 inches more leg room did make a difference in comfort. At the seat was placed a pillow and blanket, along with headphones. There was also a very basic amenity kit that just had an eye mask, ear plugs and hand lotion. The pouch itself opens up to a small bag. The meal service on both flights was pretty bland. I also observed that on recent Economy Class flights, the alchoholic drinks served is rather meagre. The wine in the small paper cup was only half full. On one occasion, when I requested whiskey, I felt embarrassed to have no more than a tablespoon served - just enough for one sip!

The food was average, and the tray was served without any paper, directly with the meal. Etihad's quality has significantly declined.

9452,9452,Etihad Airways,7,"""Business Class product is good""",6th June 2024,True,"  I had flown Etihad's Boeing 787  in Business Class before, and privacy-wise, the seating is not as good as the A380. Even from my window seat, the rear seat facing passengers was clearly visible. The spacious cabin and decor looked beautiful, and the seat itself, identical to that in the A380s was very comfortable. On boarding, I was addressed by name and pointed in the direction of my seat. The usual, pre-flight drinks and hot towels followed, and pushback was on time. Soon after take off, my dinner order was taken. The dishes listed on the à la carte menu were all enticing, and I chose Salmon for starters. With a choice of four main courses, it was Prawn Biriyani, which was excellent. There was no second meal served as such, instead the 'dine on demand' meant you could order from the 'all-day dining' menu. I had their famous Steak Sandwich and a beer, which was also very good. The cosy 28-seat, 1x2x1 layout cabin (which is becoming more the industry standard) was full. Yet the flight attendants managed to briefly chat with most of us, and several times asked if I needed anything else. The new grey 'cube' bag amenity kit placed on my table looked cute, but was very basic, with a few ESPA lotions, eye shades and a dental kit. The touch screen IFE worked well, however, the choice of new movies was not that great since I last flew eight months ago. Instead, I decided to watch a couple of TV sitcoms before preparing for bed. Most of the seat and lighting adjustments could be controlled both from the side table, as well as from the small tabletop monitor. As it was a night departure, I was hoping to get some rest. Etihad provides slippers, but no PJs for a nine-hour flight. However, the large pillow, mattress pad and duvet sufficed. Adjusting the seat for a harder or softer feel also made a difference. As I sipped my nightcap of black coffee and cognac by my side, and the cabin lights dimmed, I drifted into a good four sleep.

9453,9453,Etihad Airways,6,"""nothing really to complain about""",6th June 2024,True,"  I hadn't flown Etihad's Economy Class for a long time and wasn't exactly looking forward to a nine and a half hour flight to Abu Dhabi, an eight hour layover, and another seven hour flight back to London. The check-in and boarding process at Kansai Airport was poorly handled. It was agonizingly slow, with business class and economy passengers being moved about to different counters. At the boarding gates, unlike some flights where there are dedicated spaces for each flight, here we were crowded between two flight queues right next to each other, both boarding at the same time. One staff member was carrying a small placard walking up and down the queue, advising which group of rows could start boarding. However, the flight was only delayed by 20 minutes. The first flight on the Dreamliner has a 3x3x3 layout. The seat itself and legroom was reasonably comfortable, I guess only because I am not tall. The flight was full and the service began as soon as the seat belt sign was turned off. There were two meal services on this flight. It was sad to see how much the size of the meal tray has shrunk. The first meal ran out of choice, and I had to settle for some bland pasta. Having apologized, I was promised a choice of the second meal and the shrimp curry with rice which was delicious. Drinks were served with meals, and followed by coffee or tea afterwards. Later I was able to request an extra drink, but had to wait a long time to be served. The seat has about 3 inches recline, although mine wasn't working. Once the lights were dimmed, I did manage to nod off a for an hour or so. At Abu Dhabi, before the flight back to London, I was relieved to relax at Etihad's Business Lounge as I was a Guest Member. Boarding at Abu Dhabi was expertly handled, with clear messaging for which seating rows to come forward. On the A380 to Heathrow, I had paid for an 'extra legroom seat', which has 4 more inches of extra space, and did make a difference in comfort. Located in the front of the aircraft, and curtained off like a separate cabin, it felt more relaxing. The onboard service was of course the same as the rest in Economy class. It was a bright blue sky day as we departed on time. The interactive IFE route map showed the exterior tail camera and an excellent view of the aircraft taxing and taking off. Both flights were nothing special, and the service was as you would expect on a long-haul economy class flight. The A380 was certainly more comfortable than the Dreamliner. Although non-engaging, on both flights, the cabin crew were professional, so I have nothing really to complain about.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Etihad-A380-Economy-Class-Extra-Leg-Room-Seat-Abu-Dhabi-to-London-2-500x500.jpg,Boeing 787 / A380,Business,Economy Class,Osaka to London Heathrow via Abu Dhabi,May 2024,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,,4.0,yes,neutral,0.5364751219749451,4.7312726974487305,stretcher
9456,9456,Etihad Airways,8,“I did enjoy it very much”,4th June 2024,True," Nearly eight months ago, I took this exact flight to Abu Dhabi, and was expecting the same professional onboard service I enjoyed before. This time flying with cabin baggage only - a generous 12 kg, plus another 5kg 'handbag'. I therefore understood why they had to weigh each item on check-in. The boarding process was swift, and I was served both champagne and a lovely mint and lemon drink as soon as I settled down. Hot towels followed, and slippers were provided. Etihad's 'dine on demand' for some reason did not materialize nor was it offered. Soon after take off, and at cruising altitude, the bar service followed, and lunch was served. For the rest of the flight the à la carte 'all-day dining menu' meant I could request the next meal or snack when needed. A nice touch is that I could also order my drinks from the IFE monitor. Seat comfort adjustments, massage and lighting could be controlled both from the side table, as well as from the small tabletop monitor. If I had something to mildly grumble about, two noticeable differences compared to my previous flight was - a new but very basic ESPA amenity kit (I missed the cologne which was included in their previous Acqua di Parma products). I was also rather disappointed with the lack of more new movies, although there was plenty to choose from TV shows, documentaries, news channels and games. Later, I spent a little time at the small lounge which was empty, and helped myself to a drink at the self-service bar, and a crew member served me coffee and chocolates. Although the necessary bedding was provided, like a soft mattress, duvet and large pillow, I resisted a nap as I had a long layover ahead of me on my next flight from Abu Dhabi, and would get some sleep at their lounge. A non-eventful flight, nevertheless as before, I did enjoy it very much, especially the friendly cabin crew.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Etihad-A380-Business-Class-LHR-to-Abu-Dhabi-May-24-1-500x500.jpg,A380,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Abu Dhabi,May 2024,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0,,4.0,yes,positive,0.598284900188446,6.9428935050964355,passenger car

Warm drinks, no ice and 2 small drinks on an 8 hour flight. No tea or coffee facilities unless you went to them. There was no entertainment on board the flight.

Eurowings Discover is the worst airline. My original flight was cancelled due to Lufthansa protests and we were booked 7 days later with a Eurowings discover flight to For Myers. I was traveling with my 1 year old baby girl and my 7 year old son. As soon as we got to our seats, we noticed everyone's TV's had power but our did not. We asked the flight attendant to please turn on our screens and she just replied that they are out of order and the flight is fully booked so they can't do anything. I replied that this is unacceptable. We're traveling with children on a 10 and a half hour flight, why was I sold these seats if the screens don't operate? She just said, I'm sorry I will ask my cabin manager if we can do something.  The flight attendant never returned with a solution. I then pulled a 2nd attendant and asked to speak to the cabin manager. Another hour goes by and still nothing! I got very upset. It seemed like nobody cared that they took our money and everyone had working screens but us. I got up and went to the attendant zone. I waited 20 minutes to speak to someone. A guy came out and said, that he apologized but there is nothing he can do except to send a message to the airline that will send partial reimbursement for the inconvenience. We had the most boring flight. The food that was served to us was disgusting. We were given a sandwich with  carrots and soggy cheese on a cold bread.  I asked if I can purchase food of any sort other than what they gave us, and all they had to offer us for a purchase was a chocolate stick, a snickers bar or peanuts. The drinks they served were tiny 3 inch plastic cups filled half way with water or soda. The seat had no bassinet attachment for the baby and I had to hold her in my hands for 10 and a half hours. Previous airlines I've traveled to Europe with had a bassinet attachment and the baby sleeps in that. All in all, absolutely the worst food, worst experience flying.  Empty promises that they will send a partial credit. As we walked out they waved bye and we never  received an apology email or a credit.

The overall product offered by EVA Airways exceeded our expectations, and they were consistently on time with their departures and arrivals.

9630,9630,EVA Air,1,"""This is really impeccable service""",30th May 2023,True,"  I have been a loyal EVA customer for many years. I have earned their Gold Status (Infinity MileageLands). I needed to redeem my frequent flier points before the end of June. Thankfully they had extended the expiration date a few times because of COVID19. I decided to redeem the points and fly from Chiang Mai to Vancouver. After being frustrated with doing the online booking myself, the Taipei office (loyalty) kindly phoned me and walked me through the process and everything was perfect. Once in Vancouver I decided to make a trip over to Toronto and I needed to extend my EVA ticket. This time the Taipei and the Chiang Mai office worked together to make that possible for me. I am very grateful to the Taipei office along with Zee and his Chiang Mai office colleagues. Again, the onboard service offered by EVA just doesn't get any better. There are little things that make a difference. At the door, they check your name on the boarding pass and then greet you by name. Each time they speak to you afterwards they refer to you by name. The FA takes you to your seat. When they speak to you, they do not bend down but rather get down to your level and speak to you. When you use the lavatory, on the way out they ask you if there is anything that you need. This is really impeccable service. The food is wonderful along with the wines and cocktails. This excellent service is not a one-off for me but rather what I have experienced before in business class from EVA. When I have had difficulty in the past, I have found that the ""loyalty"" department at Taipei is most helpful and I can say that same about the Chiang Mai office. I did note that I was not eligible for the free WiFi since I was on an award ticket. That is unfortunate because one receives the points to use an award from being a frequent flier.

Boarding was done by zone but there were no clear information on where to line up for each zone and which zone is currently boarding so it was quite chaotic. Unless I asked to the gate agent about our transfer from a United flight, we won't know that our United-generated boarding passes have to be exchanged with EVA ones to be able to use the automated gate and our baggage tags needs to be stamped. In LAX they used the new automated gates that makes the boarding process quite slow since many people don't know how to properly scan their boarding passes. Once on board, the flight attendants were very efficient in how to help passengers with their luggage and finding their seats. They were very polite but still ensure that all safety precautions are followed. Once we were airborne and the service started, the FAs were very courteous and helpful, and give a very good service. They informed us of the two meals we will be served on board and the timing of the second meal (two hours prior to land) and there are snacks available in between. Service started with a welcome drink (water, orange juice, wine or beer) then dinner. Once dinner was served and cleaned, they dimmed out the cabin lights so passengers can sleep. Throughout the evening flight the FAs made frequent rounds with water or OJ. The restrooms were kept clean and there were ample amenities there (toothbrush, toothpaste, lotion, etc.) at all times. The orchid decoration on the restroom wall is a very nice touch. Inflight entertainment is quite good but the layout is quite confusing. I didn't know they have many more options until the last moments before we started our descent. The lights came back on just before second meal (breakfast) is served, a very tasty Chinese congee. The captain made announcements regarding the planned trip before we leave, and about the current condition at Taipei airport before we start our descent. We land and got to our gate C5 ahead of time.

9649,9649,EVA Air,3,"""so bad and customer unfriendly"" ",12th December 2022,True," My wife and I, we are really outraged by the way we have been treated by the EVA AIR – BR75 team. The flight times have been moved up to 5 times, due to technical issues. Finally it was the next day. In the meantime we received 2 food vouchers, which could be used at a limited number of shops. The route from the gate to the shops was a long walk and then back. We are an elderly couple and not very mobile. By the time we got to a snack shop, there was already a queue of 50 people. Reason: many of those kind of shops were closed due to renovations. So we had to walk even further. At the end of the day we had to go to another gate; we had to wait again, without further information. Finally, we followed the whole group of people to the immigration gate, we had to hand over our passports. It is therefore forbidden according to the Dutch government to hand over your passport. Only if there is legal approval for this. A copy of our passports was not accepted. If we refuse, they wouldn't help us any further. So we had to do this. After a 30 minute bus ride we arrived at a hotel. Waiting endlessly again. We got a very basic room, no hot water, no luggage. We got a meal, went to bed exhausted at 11 pm, got up at 3 am, because we had to take the bus to the airport at 4 am. Waiting again, no one from EVA AIR was there to explain anything. 500 passengers, in small groups, were searching for information or help. The flight was not listed. And only around 07:30, the staff arrived and boarding could begin. We had to wait a long time for our passports, because a pile of numbered passports had been dropped. We are regular customers of EVA AIR, but we don't recognize the service anymore. This was so bad and customer unfriendly. This brings down the reputation of the company way down.

When we got to our seat there was a pillow and a blanket with headphones and cleaning wipes waiting for us. The blanket was very comfy and soft and so was the pillow. The seat was large and very nice for this 12 hour flight. We started cruising and went on the IFE screen, there was a lot of movie options and kid options, a few games, the flight map was excellent. The food options were very good. Chinese and a western option. Either Prawn and potato pie or Chicken thigh with black bean sauce. I chose the chicken thigh with Pineapple juice and Tea. I loved it, it was a good portion, had lots of flavour, it was a good sized meal. Very very tasty. Then I mostly slept. I got up and went to the bathroom, the crew were putting away the trolleys. They were very nice, this very kind crew came up to me and offered me some snacks. Of course I said yes. Then I slept more after that. Woke up and a few hours later breakfast was served. Prawn fried rice or eggs, I chose the fried rice. Again lots of flavour, it was another good portion and it was extremely tasty. I had tea and cranberry juice with it. Then we landed in Bangkok.

9660,9660,EVA Air,8,"""I did enjoy my flight""",26th September 2022,True,"  With so much praise has been given to EVA Air's Royal Laurel Class, I was looking forward to my flight to Bangkok. The experience began at the check-in desk, which was swift and friendly. The boarding was also methodically carried out, with business class passengers invited first. The cabin has a 1x2x1 layout with a reverse herringbone configuration, and mine by the window. The decor was pleasant, with olive green, shades of grey and brown colours. The seat itself looked cosy and comfortable. Settling down, I took a moment to explore the settings. The armrest could be lifted or lowered. There was the usual adjustable reading lamp and areas for storing small items and drinks. The seat adjustments at first looked complicated, but I eventually got the hang of it. The TV monitor was set at an angle opposite and had to be clipped open to be viewed. Headphones were also in their own compartment. The fold-out table was especially large and sturdy. Good quality slippers, Jason Wu designer pyjamas and a decent amenity kit were also provided. PJs were really welcome and should be standard on long-haul journeys. Once boarding was complete, pre-departure drinks came. When I requested Champagne, I was told it is prosecco for now, but champagne with supper. Seemed rather odd! At cruising altitude, the 'supper' service began. The menu was displayed on the monitor, and there was a good selection of soft drinks, spirits, wines, and teas. I had pre-ordered my main course for both 'supper' and 'refreshment' meals. The seafood main course of tiger prawns, with cashews in a spicy bean sauce, vegetables, and rice was delicious. But the choice of wine was just red or white. For afters, it was cheese and biscuits, with walnuts and pieces of fruit. However, I was disappointed to see a branded package of mini Jacobs crackers - it just cheapened the presentation. In my experience, biscuits and crackers should be served loose. The service was rather rushed, with no drinks refills unless asked for. I also had to ask for a coffee before tucking into sleep. Once 'supper' was over, the cabin crew just retreated to the galley area until two hours before landing, when a 'refreshment meal' was served. My main course was an Asian affair - noodles with shrimp won ton, char siew pork and other dim sum items which was tasty, and this time asked for champagne and got it. EVA Air offers an excellent business class hard product. The cabin crew, although polite, were just not engaging. The was a lack of proper etiquette and finesse when serving food and drink or attending to passengers. However, it did not deter me and I did enjoy my flight all the way to Bangkok.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/EVA-Air-Boeing-777-Business-Class-seat-500x500.jpg,Boeing 777,Business,Business Class,London Heathrow to Bangkok,September 2022,5.0,2.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,4.0,yes,positive,0.9356608986854552,4.604852676391602,minivan

Thus, the aisle space was very wide and the seat was very comfortable. Despite the seat being near to the toilet, this was not much of a problem. Furthermore, legroom was plenty and the seat was wide. The Inflight Entertainment was large and responsive, but offered a limited variety of movies. There was only one seatback pouch and it would have been nice to have additional storage areas like additional pouches for smaller things.

9702,9702,Evelop Airlines,1,"""This airline is a clear disappointment""",9th July 2019,True," This airline is a clear disappointment. Had I known I wouldn’t be on a Norwegian plane where I at least know what to expect, I would have changed my flight immediately. On the way to Dublin, I was asked to give up my seat that I paid for by the flight attendants because the airline hadn’t set room for them to sit together in the back? I told them they could move me to first class where there’s a window so I can sleep (I had been up for 36 hours at this point and bought this seat for a specific reason), which they laughed off and then denied me. Apparently that didn’t sit well with them because I was ignored the rest of the flight by not being offered food or drink off of the cart, blatantly raising my hand and waving at the nearest attendants who, facing me, happened to not see me acting as if something was on fire. I had to call over two attendants when I saw them since they also didn’t want to answer my call button. One attendant told me nothing was available except a brownie, gummy snacks, and drinks. About 15 minutes later, I grabbed another attendant who politely checked again and got me noodles so I could take my medication. Now, I’m returning home and this plane is disgusting. We were to board at 1.30pm and fly at 2.30pm. We boarded just after 2. I purchased priority seating because I was not going to deal with the mess of waiting and I still had to wait an extra 20 minutes in the corridor. Apparently, the plane was on base last night or early morning but was stuck in a queue and couldn’t move to be cleaned and sorted? I’m not sure, but while we were in the corridor, an attendant asked a maintenance man for extra toiletries for the flight as there weren’t any. Now, I get to my seat and there’s crumbs all over, on the floor, and I get it. Flights back to back but when the plane has been on base for this many hours, it’s unacceptable. I look to my right and there’s nothing but trash, napkins, what looks like a McFlurry lid, food, etc. just in this one area. I have never, ever flown on a plane so gross and useless.

Soon after I was offered a drink. To say the crew were in a rush was an understatement, little to no interaction, just get the job done. Very impersonal.

9895,9895,Finnair,3,"""very poor Finnair service""",25th May 2024,True,"  Shame on you Finnair for daring to not only serve the exact same lilliputian so called ""meals"" in Economy AND in Premium Economy on my flight from Helsinki to Singapore on May 22 2024. The super mini portions both for late dinner and breakfast were plain horrible. Not only bland but really bad. I did not order special meals but will be doing so on the return in September just to check if, by some kind of magic, that could improve the experience though my expectations are now super super low. Should I add that, believe it or not, there was NO sparking water. None at all apparently or the crew was too lazy to get some from the business class. I am not drinking alcohol but was kindly offered to drink some instead of sparkling water. Also facing high sugar issues due to pancreas surgery I avoid sugary or artificially sweetened drink. I asked for a large bottle of water. The crew said they would get some but never did. Very little interaction with the crew members who, most of the time, were busy at the back of the plain, with themselves. Having visibly a great time. Should I mention that I am one of those top tier frequent flyers. For those with no status rest reassured that it made absolutely no difference at all for the crew. Anyway very poor Finnair service. Absolutely not enjoyable at all on that flight. I am writing this review as I just discovered that apparently I boarded the first flight to Singapore enjoying the ""summer menus"". Marketingwise Finnair is doing a fantastic job describing them on their website but in the air that is a complete different story. Awful. Shameful. Was that an error? I asked the crew but they said no. Not an error. Same incredibly poor food offering in Economy AND Premiums Economy. So basically you only pay double or more in Premium compared to Economy for the privilege of enjoying a much better seat (yes very comfortable indeed) as well as a better headset and blanket. First airline in the Oneworld alliance making that step to my knowledge. I am NOT positively impressed at all. Plus the service in general on board that flight was really poor. Shame on you Finnair! Last comment: the only item from the food offering I enjoyed was the large yoghurt served with the tiny omlet before landing in Singapore. Creamy, tasty and not much sugar (total).",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240522_013923-500x500.jpg,A350-900,Solo Leisure,Premium Economy,Helsinki to Singapore,May 2024,4.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,3.0,,3.0,no,negative,0.8430097699165344,6.324985980987549,pot pie
9907,9907,Finnair,9,"""all friendly and welcoming""",22nd January 2024,True,"  Our check in in the Business area was quick and the check-in agent was very welcoming. We used the express security lane, but this ended up taking as long as the regular line due to some disorganised passengers. Once through Security, we made use of the lounge until our flight. On board the aircraft was spotlessly clean. The pilots were Finnish and the Cabin Crew were Indian. Cabin crew members were all friendly and welcoming and did a great job looking after the passengers. The flight was slightly late leaving, but time was made up on the way and we actually arrived in Delhi slightly early. The food was nicely presented. The salmon caviar and onion / beetroot puree did not appeal to my personal taste, but I enjoyed the chicken curry and both desserts. The seat was comfortable enough to sit in, but lying on it was a bit cramped and uncomfortable. I suffer from claustrophobia when I am in a confined space and lying my back with my legs in the small space felt like lying in a coffin, so when lying, I lay on my sides. I would have preferred the old style seats commonly used by airlines to these seats. They were easy to maneuver into the sleeping position though. There was a reasonable selection of entertainment for the length of the flight, but I was disappointed that the map did not track the aircraft's path and flight. The rest of my family were well looked after and our children got a few hours sleep and we woke them just before the descent. The captain made a nice firm landing into Delhi and all 6 of our bags were safely waiting for us at the baggage carousel when we arrived at it 30 minutes later. A common complaint with reviewers in Skytrax is luggage going missing. I recommend to everyone that you remove the tags and barcode stickers from your luggage either when you collect it, or before you next check it in as machinery in the luggage system may misread and spit luggage with old barcodes out leading to baggage handling mistakes.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/LTM-nose-Helsinki-500x500.jpeg,A330-300,Family Leisure,Business Class,Helsinki to Delbi,January 2024,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,1.0,5.0,yes,positive,0.6760293841362,6.249012470245361,airliner

On board, the crew were very smartly dressed and genuinely friendly, welcoming and helpful. The aircraft (OH-LZS) was clean and tidy - actually I'd say spotless. I was disappointed that for a 3 hour flight, there were no films available on screens and the WIFI had to be paid for, so accessing films via a tablet was not an option. I think Finnair can improve here and also put in some seats with a bit more padding when they refresh the aircraft's interiors. We did purchase some food, which was medicre - my son was not impressed with the pizza, but last night, we did have the most amazing pizzas in Rome which will be hard to beat. The blueberry juice is nice and although I was disappointed that the food I ordered was covered in mayonnaise - it was a generous portion.

If there is 0 star for the review, I'll give it to this company. This is the worst airline I've ever taken. My most current experience is as follows: You won't receive any check in notice email at all and then they will charge you $25 for each person. You can only have one carry-on no matter how small it is. Don't expect this company to allow one tiny hand bag and one back pack. (WestJet or Air Canada is better). I was told by the check in lady that they are not a big company so they will surely charge more more on anything including check in luggage, carry-on,... Etc. The attitude of the staff is not friendly as other airlines. It may be because they can't see the future of this company. Not many people know this company So it took me a long time to find out where to check in. First trouble is the hotel shuttle bus driver didn't know where to drop me off. Even LAX police or airport staff have to ask someone else to give me the direction.. You need to pay extra to sit together and the check in staff won't let you know that so you can pay until I was boarding. This is so wrong to give your customers no options when checking in. There no app. They still give you a paper boarding pass which is easy to get lost. The stewardesses didn't even bother asking each passenger if drinks or snacks are needed. It ended up they finished the job faster.(about 15 to 20 minutes) I can feel the anger from the passengers because almost no passengers stopped them for a drink or snacks. No one even purchased. There is no way to charge your devices at your seat. The announcement is too loud. The seat back is so thin that I can always feel my back is pushed by the passenger behind me during the 3 hour trip. There is no extra head part on the seat back for tall passengers to adjusted the head rest part. 13. The dirtiest washroom I have ever seen.  I won't take this airliner ever again. I later found out during the flight that my wife has an vacant seat by the window beside her. So the check in lady did this on purpose. What a terrible company training.

French bee should have a policy that if a service animal is over a certain size, the passenger must purchase two seats. I essentially paid for this guy's extra space for his service dog! (Again, my wife had to move to a seat without extra leg room). When we pointed out the problem to the flight crew, although at least 3 different members came over to look at the situation and all did the ""hmmm, I see the problem"" thing, none of them did anything about it.

When I got on an a steward very rudely yelled at me that the carrier needed to be zipped. I complied with his request and zipped the bag closed with one hand, not realizing I didn’t zip the bag all the way closed. The bag was still 5% open. I get halfway on the plane and another stewardess said it needed to be closed all the way. Not realizing, I say the bag on an empty seat and proceeded to close the rest of the bag. The stewardess then told me I had to go back because the male steward wanted to see me. I back tracked and went to the front of the plan where he told me I could get off! I politely asked why? He said I told you to close that carrier. I told him I did, but didn’t realize a small part still remained opened. He yelled at me well that’s not what my co-worker said.

10741,10741,Garuda Indonesia,1,“Be careful about your cabin baggage”,8th December 2024,True," Strange Carry-on luggage policy. Basically your carry-on luggage must fit into some strange metal frame the airline invented to measure your cabin baggage size. My luggage is sold as cabin baggage and all airlines I flew so far have allowed me to carry on this luggage into cabin. I flew Garuda from ICN to DPS right before and I could bring my cabin luggage into my seat and compartment. But suddenly I was not allowed to carry the same one into the cabin in this domestic route because mine does not fit into their metal frame. Of course they asked me to check in and charge me extra cost. I think it is a new scam that the airline invented to hassle passengers and to take your money at the airport. Be careful about your so-called cabin baggage when you fly this hopeless one. We fly FSC, instead of LCC, expecting some margin of leniency. But this Indonesian one does not have such a professional leniency.

It's no surprise that Garuda Indonesia was awarded as The World's Best Cabin Crew. The attentiveness and professionalism of cabin crew made the experience enjoyable and memorable. Starting with the positive aspects, the welcome drink and bottle of water provided on the ground were appreciated. However, including a small sweet treat, such as a piece of candy or some snacks, would have added a delightful touch to the welcome service. On this flight, I requested a seafood meal. The first service commenced approximately 25 minutes after take-off, during which a starter of salmon tart was served. Before the lights were turned out, which was approximately an hour after take-off, the second service began. I received a tuna sandwich as a light snack or an in-between course. One of the cabin crew accidentally offered me a regular meal, and I opted for the chicken pie, resulting in my receiving two snacks. Despite this, it enhanced my dining experience satisfaction. In terms of the meal schedule, I suggest serving a hot meal during the light snack or in-between course service, not just during breakfast or the pre-landing meal. This adjustment would provide passengers with a satisfying dinner option and contribute to a more comfortable journey pace. Approximately halfway through the journey, juice service was provided. Integrating the light snack or in-between course during the juice service, midway through the flight, could better align with passengers' hunger levels and create a more seamless dining experience. About an hour and 50 minutes prior to landing, breakfast or a pre-landing meal was served, which consisted of appetizers and a hot meal. For the appetizer, I received mixed fruit, yogurt, a bread roll accompanied by strawberry jam and butter. For the hot meal, I was served stir-fry noodles with sweet and sour seafood.

The second service (entree) commenced approximately an hour after take-off, consisting of king prawns with vermicelli noodles and mixed veggies. A bread roll and butter were also served on the entree tray. A suggestion for improvement is for Garuda to use pure butter instead of canola spread. The third service (main course) was served around 2 hours after take-off, featuring a hot meal of rice with sweet & sour seafood mix and cap cay. A dessert, mango pudding, was also included on the main course tray. I strongly recommend serving the dessert separately from the main course, while placing the bread on the entree tray and the side dishes on the main course tray. This approach allows passengers to fully savor each dish, enhancing the overall dining experience on your flights. After finishing the main course, a crew member offered me tea/coffee while I enjoyed the dessert. I opted for a cup of tea, which came with a mini chocolate bar. Approximately 2-3 hours before landing, sweet and savory snacks were offered, along with a beverage service. An hour prior to landing, a pre-landing snack and a final beverage service were served.

10836,10836,Georgian Airways,1,"“Flabbergasted, exhausted and appalled”",8th October 2024,True," My son and I had a flight scheduled from Milan’s Bergamo airport Tbilisi and due to an issue at the airport most flights were delayed, cancelled or redirected to another airport in Milan. Our experience with Georgian Airways is that they have zero customer service or any kind of communication to us or the airport, they do not answer phone calls, or respond to emails. Luckily, my husband was in Tbilisi and had to physically attend their head office to see any Georgian Airways representative. At that time, he was given a phone number of a person in Milan that is a key contact for the airline in the city. Initially, this individual was responsive and supported enquiries from both myself and my husband. However, as time went on, the Georgian Airways flight disappeared from the airport’s announcement boards and so did the support of this Georgian airways representative. She stopped responding to messages from me and calls from my husband. We had no information at all for 12 hours about the flight and then the flight reappeared on the airport information board as “cancelled” but no remedy was offered. My son and I spent almost 24 hours at the airport not knowing anything and how we might get back to Tbilisi. The next morning, as we were collecting our checked in luggage, an unscheduled flight by Georgian Airways to Tbilisi appeared on the information board as being “redirected” to the other Milan airport. These flights normally only run on Tuesdays and Fridays between Bergamo and Tbilisi. I contacted the Georgian Airways representative again, thinking this must be our replacement flight. I was not holding out hope for her response given her lack of communication back to me the previous night but her answer shocked me even more. She advised that our flight was redirected in the middle of the night and had already left Milan. Flabbergasted, exhausted and appalled would be the least of the emotions experienced at this point. I asked her how this could be possible when none of the airport staff knew anything about the flight until it was cancelled at 11pm, plus there was no contact from Georgian Airways via email or phone, no airport announcements, or contact from her when she knew I was stranded in the airport with a child. My husband had to go to the head office again and was only able to get a no cost replacement flight for us on the Friday schedule with my photo evidence of the information board stating the flight cancellation and evidence of the lack of response from their Milan representative in my WhatsApp messages. I do believe that the airline made up an elaborate lie about transferring the flight in the middle of the night to abscond from the service responsibilities - my husband advised that they were very reluctant and gave multiple conflicting reasons in order to make us pay again. I hope this experience deters you from using this airline or at least you will be fully informed on what to expect if things go wrong.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_1358-500x500.png,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Milan to Tbilisi,October 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,negative,0.6971051692962646,6.07125186920166,website
10843,10843,Georgian Airways,1,"""no customer support to compensate the damage""",20th July 2023,True,"  I do not recommend anyone to fly with this company because they have 0 customer support and Georgian Airways is not responsible for any loss or damage they cause. In my case, they broke my suitcase which was split in halves. As I noticed it, I immediately concluded a damage report at the official Georgian Airways counter at Tbilisi airport, just upon my arrival. The manager told me to get in touch with 'Customer Service' by email, and I did it later on the same day. After two weeks with no single reply, I forwarded my complaint and the damage report to the email address again and included the general address as well. After a month of waiting for nothing I reached the central office of Georgian Airways on Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi. There were four operators working, and they told me they do not have anyone responsible for damaged baggage and no customer support as it is. They asked me to address the issue at the same counter at the airport having given a phone number for me to call. When I called the number the manager from that end replied that she is only in charge of the lost luggage and no way she can deal with the damaged one. I left Tbilisi and was abroad for a while and when I came back to the same airport I approached the manager at the same old desk of Georgian Airways with the same old issue. She shouted at me saying she does not know anything. When I demanded to leave a claim and paper complaint she refused to help and just started ignoring me. In the process, I have also reached the airport administration which politely said they can not assist me with the claim. So, the conclusion is obvious and just one. Georgian Airways is not responsible for anything. If they cause damage to you or your belongings there is no customer support to compensate the damage or simply help you.

11225,11225,Greater Bay Airlines,2,“this was a sour experience at best”,16th February 2024,False," Initially the ticketing process is noticeably behind the times but nothing too terrible. Just don’t expect to get a boarding pass right when you purchase the ticket. You must get one from the gate agent. The boarding process was smooth and they were fine with me having one personal bag and a roller board in the overhead. But they made my girlfriend check her bag. The real problems started in flight. We knew this was a low cost carrier so our expectations weren’t very high (despite paying an obscene amount for the tickets, $900 USD for the two of us!). Regardless, we had just flown in from the United States so we were both very jet lagged and just wanted to sleep. My biggest bone to pick was that it was an evening/nighttime flight and they kept the full, bright, cabin lighting on the entire flight. The picture I attached is over 2 hours into the flight. I asked them why they wouldn’t dim the lights so people could sleep and they said it was so “people could eat”. Even though there were no meals even being served. And even if people were eating, they had personal lights to use so it was very odd that they felt the needed to keep the entire cabin lit up for the select few that might be eating. This made no sense to me, as it was a 5 hour nighttime flight. I am a very frequent traveller and spend probably about 50% of my waking life on airplanes, and on every other carrier I’ve flown, the cabin gets dimmed after food & beverage service even on daytime flights. And despite the quality of service in the United States usually being well behind this part of the world, this was without a doubt the worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Not only were the flight attendants dismissive but just downright oblivious of why simple things like never dimming the lights affects the quality of a flight. It didn’t help that the seats were small and it would’ve been more comfortable to sit on a park bench for 5 hours. The food and drinks were nonexistent unless you wanted to pay a pretty penny for something. All in all, for the price that we paid, this was a sour experience at best. I highly recommend you avoid this airline at all costs unless you are out of options. Or at least do not expect a comfortable seat, ride, experience, or to be taken care of in any aspect. 2/10 on a good day.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/IMG_3903-500x500.jpeg,Boeing 737-800,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,"Narita, Japan to Hong Kong",December 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,negative,0.6410468220710754,5.299860954284668,minivan

Each seat has direct aisle access. There were 2 meals on this sector - dinner and light meal. There were some service lapses on this sector. Dinner service did not commence until almost 2 hours after departure and given the late departure from Singapore after a one hour delay, it was almost midnight when dinner was served. The amenity kit was given out only just before landing in Bahrain - it should have been given out at the start of the flight - blankets were not distributed at the start of the flight. The flight attendant placed a blanket over me while I was sleeping. I am not finding fault with the crew. They did their very best given the shortened turnaround time in Singapore to make up for the late inbound flight. The second sector to Milan with a brief stop in Rome was operated by a narrow body A321 Neo. Again two meals were served - supper and breakfast. I had the mezze for supper and omelette and sausage for breakfast. Both were delicious. Amenity kit, blanket, slippers and pyjamas were distributed on this 6 hour flight to Rome.

She couldn’t sit properly for the entire 10-hour flight, and since the seat couldn’t fully recline either, she couldn’t lie down to rest. Imagine trying to sit in a plane for 10 hours, with the seat constantly shaking from turbulence, and no back support. My mother had to rely entirely on her core strength just to stay upright. It was physically exhausting and incredibly uncomfortable, leaving her with back pain after the flight. The flight attendants tried to fix the seat, but nothing worked. To make matters worse, a Korean-speaking flight attendant assured us we would be refunded for the broken seat, but after the flight, Hawaiian Airlines refused to offer any cash compensation. Instead, they gave us a useless travel voucher that expires in a year, despite us not having any travel plans within that time. It feels like the flight attendant deliberately lied to us just to avoid further complaints during the flight. This left us feeling deceived and extremely frustrated, adding insult to injury after such a terrible experience. Even worse, despite me being the one who suffered, they acted as if they were doing me a favor by throwing a voucher my way, which made the whole situation even more infuriating.

This company was drafted in to replace the original Thomas Cook flight (MT2817). The flight was due to take off at 17.00 but we didn’t start boarding until nearly 17.00. Like most people, we didn’t rush as we had boarding passes with allocated seat numbers. Some people had also paid more for extra leg room seats. As we boarded the plane the cabin crew told us to just sit anywhere! This led to chaos and contributed to the delays in taking off. A storm then rolled in and at 17.55 the captain confirmed that we wouldn’t be taking off. There was no further information until 18.39 when he announced that there a was sick child on board and asked for assistance. At 19.08 a Thomas Cook/Condor plane landed in the storm. At 19.31 the captain announced that the child and parents would be leaving the plane but it wasn’t until 19.58 that the baggage belt arrived to start removing the bags. At 20.46 the captain announced that we would finally be leaving. At 20.50 the Thomas Cook plane took off – ahead of us! At 21.21 we finally took off – 4.5 hours after boarding. The cabin crew made no attempt to organise anything – not even the seating. We heard of several fights breaking out and there could well have been many more. The seats were cramped and there was no leg room. The selfish person in front of me pushed their seat back resulting in absolutely no leg room at all. My knees were crushed against the back of their seat for over 8 hours. There is no way I could have placed myself into the brace position (see image). I pointed this out to the cabin crew who, as usual, couldn’t care less. There was no entertainment at all and the only food offered was a roll with very little inside it. The only drink offered by the crew was water, however, we discovered 6 hours into the flight that hot drinks were available near the back. None of the crew bothered to tell us and we had to get up and get it ourselves This is without doubt the worst flight were have ever had to endure. The whole experience had left us reluctant to fly again. Hi-Fly should not be used as a replacement service again – they simply aren’t up to the standards required for even basic air travel.

Still, she insisted that the man was taking my place to be close to some teenagers (note that there was a space available between the teens and in the middle section Right next to it, so I don't understand the need to take my place when there are more spaces available and appropriate for the care of people in their late teens). I did not accept giving up my place and the flight attendant cursed me saying that I am inflexible and that life was going to give it back to me and that she hoped everyone is inflexible with me (in front of all the passengers) which was insuring and made my daughter cry and made us have a very difficult, awkward and unpleasant trip. I filed a complaint of which there was only an acknowledgment of receipt by the airline and they never communicated anything to me again, closing the file without any notification or report.

Looking for a reservation to visit the states this was the cheapest option, but in the end it was the most pricey one. Everything has to paid extra; luggage (+94 USD), food on the flight (pricey and not good value!), even ear buds to use the in-flight entertainment, but most of all; I was travelling with my minor son and had to pay extra 4 times (!) just to be able to sit next to him. I could live with the additional costs for food (just bring your own, you're allowed), earbuds (bring your own mini-jack compatible) and luggage (common these days), but having to pay extra to have a seat next to my son was just too much.

11934,11934,Icelandair,1,"""absolutely the worst""",16th August 2024,True," I am someone who often flies from the US to Europe and I have tried a variety of airlines, this was absolutely the worst one. Starting off for some reason seats were assign immediately, which is the first time I ever experienced that with an airline going overseas, so this was quite strange. I had to pay for my seat to be changed as well because when you click “change seat” they only give you like 3 middle seats (I am someone with an anxiety issue and much prefer window seats) and the rest you have to pay for. You have to pay for EVERYTHING. Most planes have entertainment systems and typically airlines provide you with cheap earbuds for free, but these I had to pay for and the ones I was given had an issue with one of the earbuds so it was quieter on one ear as soon as I opened it. My flights were 5h25m and 4h something, so we weren't provided a meal. Not only was the food on the plane expensive and the only free thing was soda and water, the flights were so close together I had literally 8 minutes to find my gate after border patrol so I wasnt able to get any food. This is the kicker and the main reason I am taking the time to review this. I had a checkin luggage and when I had picked it up it was COVERED in cough syrup. I had NOT packed any and you can clearly see that it was split all over my luggage and stained the outside, the inside and a lot of items in the luggage, including multiple pieces of clothing that I struggled to get the stains out and gifts that had cardboard packaging which had been damaged. As soon as I collected it a very nice lady at the airport had created a report and gave me the instructions on how to finish it, while she was apologizing about this happening saying “yes this isnt normal for this to happen”. I did it as soon as I made it to the place I am staying in, providing with plenty of pictures of the outside, inside and every individual item that had been soaking in cough syrup and explained what I can in as much detail I can, including a description of the items and prices of everything (it said that reports get thrown out if the item values are below $100 usd). I also had prepared receipts of my clothing to prove the value if I were asked because I had ordered them online and had the email confirmations. They had immediately rejected it for “proper packing” and had gave no further information except a link to terms and conditions, which looking through I couldnt find anything related to my situation. I tried to see if I could reach out to anyone about this and basically the only answer I had gotten was to submit another report. With all these little things and this happening I really recommend against this airline, as they will wave off any damage they have done and expect you to pay so much more for basic things all other airlines would provide. I will provide a couple photos I had sent them The only good thing that happened was the flight attendants. I am someone who has health issues and sometimes I vomit and it isnt something I can control. On my second flight I unfortunately did vomit and the flight attendants were so helpful. They let me stay a little around the area they tend to stay and gave me one of their seats to sit in, while at least one was monitoring me ensuring I was ok and providing me with water and bread.

Upon take off on my flight to Dulles, the overhead compartment above me and the passenger next to me started dripping water. I called and the flight attendant came and told me she was accustomed to this occurring and that it would stop in 10 mins. She bought us a blanket that was just refolded from the previous flight and not laundered before giving it to new passengers to use. The pillows on the aircraft were also being reused without a change of cover. I asked her if there was another seat that I could move to, and she said she would check and get back to me – she never returned with an answer. The dripping of water continued for an hour. I also had to pay 88 Euros for my first checked bag. This is an international flight and as such at least the first checked bag should be free like the rest of the airlines.

Flght AIJ2811 departed with 1h15 delay from Montreal where we all had to wait in a very cold corridor, standing up, or lying down, with no access to a bathroom, with crying babies, then they decided, we would board (15 min. before midnight) and for unknown reason they decided that the flight would be diverted to Cancun to fill the tank. We were supposed to get to MEX at 3h25 am. Result: we landed in Mexico more than 3hrs later, I had hired and paid for a taxi through Booking) to pick me up between 5h and 6h am. The driver waited until 4h30 and then decided to leave, Result I lost the fee for that taxi driver and then had to pay for another one from the taxi pool which is not advisable for a woman alone in Mexico. 2, On Nov. 2, I got an e-mail from Interjet that my flight was now Mexico to Montreal, Being now aware that they do change the flights at a whim, I thought that they managed to give me a direct flight to Montreal instead of the 2 flights trip I had bought. So the taxi delivered me to the area for International departures of Interjet. But no, after waiting in line for a good half hour, Seems it was a mistake, that my previous booking was still standing. So I rushed to the national departures (about the distance of a football field to cross) for my flight that was supposed to leave at 11h am. 3. But no worry that flight was late.(fl. 2370) It left at 1h45, We landed in Cancun at close to 3h00, I had to collect my luggage at the conveyor and re-register it and then had to go through security once again and then, realising that Cancun time was an hour later, I arrived at gate 56 to be told that the plane had just left. (fl.2820) 4. Re-crossing the whole airport again, they gave me another ticket back to Mexico (which left later than scheduled) with a ransfer for Montreal at 1h00 am (fl. 2811) (which actually left at 2h40 am). In conclusion I had 3 flights, spent 27 hrs in planes or at airports on that day and arrived a whole day later than expected. All because the first flight of the day was late) 5.

Not to worry, as I didn’t want to judge a book by cover. I did, however, come to judge it by its multiple equipment failures. I sat in my seat and heard the cabin creaking and squeaking. I decided that my knees crack too once in a while and it’s just a sign of aging.  The staff handed me headphones and must have chuckled once outside of everyone’s view as the plugs that they go into are broken. I tried to lip read my movie but then the system went down and It’s struggled to reboot and never came back online. I decided to see if I could get on the wifi to keep myself distracted.

Approx $3000 USD for Toronto-Chicago-Tokyo-Bangkok return (YYZ - ORD was on AA). Considering I usually pay about $2000 for economy with my extra golf bag, this seemed like a no brainer and I pulled the trigger on that fare the very next day. That decision was the correct one. I've just returned from the trip (which is an annual one) and I've never crossed half the globe and had it feel so easy. A fully lie flat bed all the way (except Toronto-Chicago) and a completely private one at that. The food was great, the service was great, the lounges were great, check in priority and fast track immigration in Tokyo/Bangkok. It was as easy as travel can be. I've flown JAL in economy before, and even then I thought it was a superior experience than our local option (Air Canada) which continues to disappoint every time. I recall even in economy the seats were wider (fewer total seats across, 8 instead of 9) and the meals were better. Well, business exceeded expectations, even after YouTube reviews had set them sky high. I have no reservations about wholeheartedly recommending them.

Unfortunately, it was not until 3 days before that I knew that I had been downgraded to Business from First because of plane change. My new plane was set to have no First Class. The services on board they offered me, however, reversed the unexpected. A chief purser assigned me a seat with next one empty. For dinner I opted for Japanese cuisine. After the first course was completed, I proposed that I should alter for Western cuisine. A flight attendant accepted it without hesitation and willingly served me a beef fillet steak as the main course, the sauce of which tasted a hint of Japanese soy sauce. I was only too happy to find my favorite Japanese sake on the beverage menu, Imanishi, brewed in Sakurai, Nara Prefecture. Also how lucky to discover a very palatable Bordeaux on board!

You might think this is not to disturb me, but I left it on the mini counter that was on the outside of my suite. After I woke up and for the remainder of the flight, they never walked up to me willingly and asked me if I needed anything.  I had to use the flight attendant call button to ask for one of the meals you can order anytime on JAL. What astonished me is the cabin attendant pretended to forget to serve the meal to me.  The head cabin attendant came to apologize to me and I told her I still wanted the meal because I haven't had anything to eat since the lunch after takeoff. She should have already guessed that also, since 12-13 hours had elapsed at that point in time. She still did not serve me the meal though.

So travel to other side of airport, go through passport control, to sit there for another hour and a half then was told the flight was cancelled. No other information was gave to us for another 45 minutes, just had to stand there waiting. Then had to walk to other side of airport to be told we’ll be getting put up in a hotel for a night and our next flight would be 1pm the next day.

",28th May 2019,True," Leeds Bradford to Thessaloniki. For the most part, this airline is fine. Both the outbound and return flights took off an hour late, not the longest of delays but a bit annoying. The pilots made up a chunk of time on the return and we arrived only 25 mins after the scheduled time. I guess the swift turnaround helped to explain the lack of cleaning. Always a bit disconcerting to open one's tray table to find the spill marks of a previous passenger’s drink (see pic). Same plane for both journeys, a 27 year-old 737-300. However, it had been retrofitted, including winglets, and the interior looked very new. Apart from it being a little noisy, the plane’s age was no issue. The seats were interesting, plastic with minimal cushioning (see pic). They didn't lean back (a good thing) and had tiny armrests (a bad thing). I suppose it allows the airline to fit more in without reducing legroom. They were comfy enough for the first couple of hours, but as we approached the third hour, the lack of cushioning started to tell + the plastic felt sticky (avoid wearing shorts). The legroom was perfectly fine for short haul. This is the first flight I’ve taken on which there were no window blinds or dimmers. A real curiosity, and I can’t think why they would be absent. It made the outbound journey uncomfortable until I fashioned a blind of my own using a sweatshirt. Until then, the sun was pretty blinding and hot. As a budget product, Jet2 is perfectly decent. Booking easy; online check-in and printing of boarding passes easy; no IFE but none was expected; didn't bother ordering food but the menu items were predictably overpriced; didn't pay for checked-in baggage as the 10kg allowance for hand luggage was enough for my short trip (well done for this in particular Jet2!). The staff were fine. Efficient and friendly enough without being overbearing. I felt a bit sorry for them to be honest, having to spend much of their time trying to sell stuff. I guess it's the necessary economy of the budget airline. I didn't like the fact that they prohibited the drinking of one's own alcoholic beverages, and only allowed us to consume those bought on board. I appreciate there’s a security aspect (being able to refuse extra drinks to very drunk people) but I suspect there’s a profit-based motivation too. Naturally, when the crew announced “you shouldn’t drink your own alcoholic drinks”, I understood it as “you shouldn’t get caught drinking your own alcoholic drinks”.

I am absolutely livid at the experience I received and the absolute lack of regard for not only their own policy but their customers. 9/25/23 - We booked a 3 hr flight from Boston to Chicago, scheduled departure time 5.35pm ET (flight B6 811) -The flight is perpetually delayed. Last officially updated delay in the JetBlue app was 9.54pm, 4.5 hours from original scheduled departure. However, despite boarding at this time, the plane sat on the runway until 10.35pm ET, a full five hours after scheduled departure. The reason for the delay, according to the flight's captain, was a mechanical issue with the engine of the original plane we were supposed to take. We ended up switching to a different flight coming in from Orlando, which did not even arrive until 8.45pm. 9/26/23 - We arrive at O'Hare around 1:30am, ET/12.30AM CT. As soon as I arrive at my destination I contact JetBlue's chat line requesting a travel credit given the delay. The woman I spoke with me assured me a credit would be issued once the flight was reviewed. - Per Jetblue's official policy, flights delayed by 3 hours are issued a $50 travel credit and an additional $50 is added per extra hour delayed up to $200. Given that this flight was delayed by five hours until take-off, proper compensation should have been $150. Even if going by the last official time of departure, 4.5 hours late, it should have been $100. - Instead, I wake up that morning to find I only received a $50 travel credit. - I use JetBlue's chat support line again to request additional compensation to reconcile the discrepancy between what I was given and what I was owed given JetBlue's own policy and the length of the delay. - Ginette tells me the flight was delayed by only 3.5 hours according to the investigation log and that she is unable to provide further compensation. When I ask why the investigation log is inaccurate and send the screenshot from the JetBlue app showing that the last updated time of departure is over 4 hours after original scheduled time, she simply repeats like a broken clock and tells me there is nothing she can do. - I ask to speak to a supervisor, to which she tells me that she is a supervisor. I ask to speak to her supervisor, and am transferred back to Ginette. She then tells me I will need to call JetBlue's line and request a supervisor. Ok fine. - So, after very little sleep on account of this delay, I call JetBlue's customer service line where I am transferred to the escalation team. - I speak to Jonathan on the escalation team who tells me essentially the same thing, the flight was delayed by 3 hours, there was no delay code in the flight, and their ops team has already reviewed the flight and determined it is only eligible for $50. When I asked why the flight says it was only delayed on their end by 3 hours when it actuality it was far longer, I am told he doesn't know and can only go by what he is told on his end. - Here I am now with only a $50 credit on a flight that should have received at least $100, if not $150. I am absolutely baffled as to why a company as large and as profitous as JetBlue would refuse to honor their own policy and extending an additional $100 credit towards customers who were delayed by five whole hours except for an all consuming avarice and absolute soulless apathy towards the paying customers who give JetBlue its revenue in the first place.

12915,12915,Jetblue Airways,1,"""they wanted us to buy a new flight""",13th September 2023,True,"  JetBlue doesn’t seem to mind jettisoning their cancelled fliers into the abyss the “Help” desk. (if they haven’t actually closed it down after you and 199+ passengers have been seated on a plane for 7 hours on the tarmac and then JB cancels and deplanes all passengers ). The freshly trained “help” crew just stare at the screens and can’t find you anything so just go sit and wait. Our janitors will sweep you up if we find you wilted and neglected in a corner on the floor. They should call it “No notice “ “No Help” Too Bad, So Sad airlines. We don’t notice how inept we are, we don’t notice you either. But we’re damned grateful you are so patient. Because, what is that motto we have plastered everywhere in our jolly blue lobbies? “We love to help. Helping’s our favorite”. Their favorite way of helping is to give you a boarding pass that has not been registered so when you are at the gate to board with a ticket in hand, they tell you they can’t find your res and close the flight door, or, get you another res and cancel it 2 hours before you fly. No stress there? 9/9/23 boarded flight 3:30pm from jfk to sfo. Taxied out for an hour, ultimately sat on plane, taxiing in and out twice, for 7 hours, then after profusely thanking us for our good behavior and unending patience, deplaned us all. The gate agent assured us that within 3 more hours we would get an email informing us of our replacement flights. We all understood that weather in the west was causing a great deal of problems. We did understand what a shit show this was going to be for everyone including JetBlue. No such email came, ever. All that came was an email informing us that the flight was cancelled with a link to “manage your flight” that sent the user around in circles or telling them they weren’t eligible, or weren’t covered or whatever. Phone calls had a wait time of 547 minutes, text links 2 hours. If one tried to reserve on this link, by the time all info was entered, the flight was unavailable. “Help “ desk was empty, no agents anywhere. Airport was closed for business in JetBlue terminal. Oh, by the way, you can’t leave this terminal area or you won’t get back in because your flight is cancelled and you will have no boarding pass to go anywhere, anytime, got that? So stick around so you don’t miss some phantom flight. A group of us heard that a “crew” was coming in to the help desk at 4am. At 4:15 am, 3 young freshly trained folks came out to man the long “help” counter because “helping” is their favorite thing to do. As a group 15 + of us had pulled up chairs to sit in because we could hardly stand any longer, having had no sleep or food, a JetBlue supervisor told us we couldn’t sit there, it was a safety hazard. Fainting in the aisle from exhaustion is not a safety hazard? Some of these people were 70 - 80 + in age, and we ultimately stood in line 3 1/2 hours. It was impossible to “manage” any flights with JetBlue through the link they gave us, basically they wanted us to buy a new flight that, if you got that far, required you to buy a seat in addition to the ticket, seats and tickets where the prices were rising as one scrolled the pages as if they were in live auction. Even if you tried to buy a ticket at inflated prices, by the time one entered all required info, when you pressed the “buy” button, the response was “sorry, we sold your seat”.

13457,13457,Kenya Airways,3,"""planes are looking shoddy on the inside"" ",3rd May 2024,True,"  I really wanted to like Kenya Airways but sadly I cannot. Firstly, our original booking was changed by the airline several months before travel. What was a Thursday flight with a 90-minute connection in NBO turned into a Friday flight with a 10-hour layover in NBO. Instead of arriving at our destination late afternoon on Friday, it became 3am on Sunday and we effectively lost 2 days of vacation. The airline would not entertain courtesy access to the lounge due to the involuntary delay (shown as US$100 for 2 adults and a child including Asante discount) but said they would pay for a day hotel outside the airport. However, they also would not pay the US$100+ to get the required ETA to leave the airport for our group to get to the hotel so it was pointless. Check-in at JFK was smooth, and the staff were friendly, even if there was a hitch meaning we could not check in online ahead of time. We were asked to pay again for the seats we had already paid US$50 per person for. This was because of whatever they did on the back-end to change our tickets from the Thursday to the Friday zeroed out our payment. We were able to show them the original booking and receipts and the fee was ""waived"". On-board the flight, the staff from JFK-NBO were not particularly friendly and the seats we had paid for had inoperable IFE system. (19 G/H/J for reference). The cabin crew tried to reset it 2 or 3 times but could not make it work. 14 hours without any entertainment. great! This was not new damage as the remote was missing in the middle seat and frayed ends showed it was not recent. Perhaps that is why the cabin crew pretty much avoided our section of the plane (as the people behind us had inoperable IFE also). We only saw them for meal service and they did not engage whatsoever. I am sure they had received complaints on the incoming flight also! After a very long flight we arrived at NBO and transited to the lounge. Not KQ's fault but only 1 security line open and people backed up all the way up the still moving escalator!! Took about 1 hour to get through but when we did we went to the lounge. Asked again about complimentary access but met with a firm ""no"". (which we expected but you have to ask!). What we did not expect was that the cost would be US$160 if we wanted to stay until our next flight and not $100 as quoted by KQ. We paid it as we were tired and wanted some nap time and some rest. Lounge was average in terms of food, but it was clean and quiet. Staff were also excellent. The flight from NBO to SEZ later in the evening was uneventful in comparison. We got on the plane, it was half full only, staff were great, IFE worked, legroom was decent, and it landed on time. What more could you ask. If there was a complaint about this flight it would be the time. 3:15AM is really late to land (or early depending on point of view), everything is closed so we couldn't get sim cards we had paid for until next day and had to book an extra day at accommodation so we could check in so early. We had hoped KQ would live up to our expectation (we had flown them in 2020 just before the pandemic hit and they were great) but realistically, the planes are looking shoddy on the inside now, and there are other options to get to SEZ and even to NBO many of which were cheaper, and we might opt for those if there is a next time to SEZ. A final note - trying to ask for the seat fee to be refunded due to the IFE issue and customer service have gone silent.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_8779-500x500.jpg,Boeing 787-8 & E190,Family Leisure,Economy Class,New York to Seychelles via Nairobi ,March 2024,1.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,,2.0,no,negative,0.7807258367538452,4.676107883453369,desktop computer
13460,13460,Kenya Airways,8,“FAs managed well the full flight”,2nd April 2024,True," Flew from Bangkok via Nairobi to Kigali 2nd April 2024 on B787-800 and B737-800, respectively. Both flights were about full and briefly on time. I had chosen my favorite seats beforehand (free for elite card status holders). Easy and fast check-in in BKK, including being given unofficial advice on how to enter Fast Track for Immigration and Security. These used to be a Skypriority perk, but they have cancelled this except for premium class travellers. The Skyteam lounge in pier F delivers and still improves on hot foods and French sparkling wine. First flight called for boarding far too early, almost 2 hours before scheduled departure. The F5 gate as KQ uses, however, is only 200 meters away from the lounge so I went back again as the dull gate hall atmosphere kills my mood. Airbridge while boarding, but bus-gating while exiting in Nairobi. Onboard could stretch my legs as I wanted as the 25th row has unlimited leg-space and they availed space to me avoiding having someone sitting at the neighbouring seat. That later enabled me to sleep well. Preordered seafood was delivered to perfection with handwritten name on it. So, we had dinner at 2 a.m., but it was very welcomed. The flight provided me 3 hot meals which is more than fair for a 9 hours flight. Inquired and got an extra portion of different nature, a freshwater fish meal, which also proved tasty. The most delicious meal was, to my surprise, the breakfast. Here they’ve made seafood pieces into scrambled eggs, extremely delicious and innovative. Drinks came around late and after food was served. The Tusker beer was awful, the white wine was undrinkable, but the red wine was surprisingly good (Shiraz grape from Stonedale Winery, South Africa). No bubbles in economy class, however. The FAs managed well the full flight. They answered call bells, were fit, jovial, and well rested, focusing on their job and talkative with passengers. Transfer in Nairobi was tedious due to bus drive and huge queues for security checks. Thus, I missed the lounge. Last flight to Kigali was more spartanic and uneventful, had to cheer up the staff. Exit seats reclinable (row 19), was again given a neighbour free seat. Boarding upon walking on the tarmac 300 meters. Catering was only a plain, cold croissant (short morning flight), but hot and soft drinks were frequently served. IFE working well (both flights) but headsets not provided. Disembarking by walking was fine to get grounded. Luggage arrived unharmed and instantly. Recommend.

13463,13463,Kenya Airways,1,"""incredibly disappointing""",4th March 2024,False,"  My recent experience with Kenya Airways was incredibly disappointing. During a transit from Nairobi to Addis Ababa, the airline made a critical mistake, resulting in us missing our connecting flight. Despite having a transit time of only one hour and 40 minutes, we were left stranded at the airport for over 24 hours without any proper assistance. After the airline acknowledged their error, they offered no immediate solution or support. We were left to fend for ourselves, with no food provided and no accommodation arranged, forcing us to sleep on uncomfortable chairs in the waiting area. Attempts to seek assistance from the manager were futile, as no help was provided. Furthermore, the lack of options for purchasing food at reasonable prices within the airport, coupled with restrictions on bringing food from outside, only added to our frustration. This experience not only caused significant inconvenience but also led to me missing out on a special occasion. I strongly advise against using Kenya Airways and urge fellow travelers to consider alternative options. The lack of basic care and assistance during such a distressing situation is unacceptable, and I have no intention of flying with this airline again.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/KENYA-3-GI-371x500.png,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Dubai to Addis Ababa via Nairobi ,March 2024,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no,negative,0.9089810252189636,-1.0,error
13468,13468,Kenya Airways,1,"""Avoid this airline like the plague""",20th January 2024,True,"  This is our first time flying with Kenya airways & will be the last. We are in Africa for a 25th anniversary trip & we were flying (KQ flight 471) from Kigali to Nairobi on 19th Jan 2024. We arrived at the airport at 7 am for the 9.10 am flight. Minutes after take-off, the pilot announced that we were returning to the gate, as a ""door latch wasn't closing"" & they needed to have it looked at. At around 10 am, after half an hour sitting on the flight, they said we needed to get off & they would give us an update. After sitting around for 3 hours, at 1 pm, we were told that we would be put on a flight at 7 pm, and that they were going to bus us to a hotel for lunch & to wait. We had a flight to Zanzibar at 6.30 pm on Jan 19th, but since we weren't even supposed to leave Kigali till 7 pm, we knew we would not make our connection. The Kenya Airways rep assured all of us that all of us would ""automatically"" be booked onto connecting flights & we didn't have to worry about a thing. Since matters were out of our hands at that time, We left with our fellow passengers & were taken to a not so nice hotel, where we were told to have lunch & wait for an update. At around 5 pm, the reception informed us that Kenya Airways had updated them that we were no longer going on the 7 pm flight, but were going to be out on a 3.40 am flight to Nairobi, the next day, January 20th. It would be more 17 hours past our original departure time, but we had no option but to wait it out, as our bags were still at the airport. Somehow, we all made it to 1 am at night, when a bus arrived to take us back to Kigali airport. Upon arrival, we were told that the 3.40 am flight(KQ 479) was delayed till 4.40 am. To make things even more chaotic, our connecting flight to Zanzibar(KQ 490) was also already delayed from 8 am to 11.20 am. I'm writing this as I sit at the airport, hoping to finally get to Zanzibar today. The total flight time from Kigali to Nairobi & Nairobi to Zanzibar is 3 hours or so, and thanks to Kenya Airways, we have already spent 27 hours at the airport & the hotel & we still don't know if we will actually get to Zanzibar today. And if our bags will be on the Zanzibar flight. Time will tell. It's only now that I'm reading all the terrible reviews of Kenya Airways. We experienced the terrible customer service first hand, with agents not having any replies to questions, absolutely no apologies from any staff for the agony caused, and long lines of angry customers at every counter. The horror stories are real. Avoid this airline like the plague, if you value your peace of mind. Anyone can understand one aircraft having ""operational issues"". But from what we saw and experienced, cancellations, delays, no accountability & no apologies are a daily way of life for Kenya Airways. How can an airline get it so wrong, so many times? Bottom line-run as fast as you can from Kenya airways, you will thank yourself that you did.

13501,13501,Kenya Airways,2,"""old-style side-by-side seating""",3rd June 2023,True,"  At a time when many airlines are improving their product, Kenya Airways appears to be going in the opposite direction. Getting onto the aircraft in Nairobi was chaotic with no priority given to business passengers – for the airline ‘Sky Priority’ means nothing. From the boarding gate we then went on a long bus journey around the airport before returning to part of the terminal to climb up stairs to get onto the aircraft. Although the cabin crew were very pleasant and offered a pre-flight drink (champagne, water or apple juice) no more drinks were served until after the meal arrived. This was a total disappointment with my beef option consisting of two small pieces of beef, some sauce and a mini samosa. It was complemented with a glass of wine in a thimble-sized glass which was only refilled when we asked the crew. One of the mysteries of the flight was why the lavatory at the front of the aircraft permanently had an engaged light on. When we asked we were told that the captain had said that it was ‘reserved for the crew and passengers could not use it’. Another mystery was a man who spent the entire flight sat on the crew jumpseat in the middle of the business section. I asked him what he was doing and he explained that the crew ‘could not find me anywhere to sit’. Given that airlines flying into the UK have a legal obligation to provide advance passenger information 24-hours before arrival it would be interesting to know how this requirement was met. Although the aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth, Kenya Airways’ 787 are let down by their old-style side-by-side seating which was worn and, in some cases, not functioning properly. The fact that the flight was full suggests that the airline has no problem selling tickets and therefore little incentive to improve its product.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_7520-500x500.jpg,Boeing 787,Business,Business Class,Nairobi to London Heathrow,June 2023,2.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,,,2.0,no,negative,0.6819326281547546,4.955093860626221,plate
13505,13505,Kenya Airways,8,"""Will fly them again""",29th March 2023,True,"  Kigali - Nairobi - Entebbe return 26-27 March 2023. Aircraft were narrowbodies. The first flight was on a B737, while the three remaining flights were on E190’s. All four (short-haul) flights were on time. This was a Mileage Run to retain my Flying Blue gold status as it otherwise was going to expire by end of the month. I was at first travel attempt denied boarding and my ticket was suspended by a junior staff in Kigali. They said, upon liaising with Immigration I Airport, that my reason to travel was not valid. I tried to change purpose, but the damage was done, which forced me to postpone the entire trip. However, later I had the ticket reissued by KQ town office in Kigali, who were professional and committed to help without any payments as it was not a No Show case. They even took over the booking from my travel agent which was effective and great relief avoiding potential additional costs. I even got a much better (and more expensive) itinerary avoiding night-flights though extending my transit lounge stays. While the junior KQ staff in airport should be sacked for denying me boarding, the KQ staff at town office should be praised and rewarded for constructive and expedite provision of resolutions and quick ticket reissue by ignoring and avoiding the OTA. The rescheduled trip went fine in all aspects. Lounge access accommodated prior to all 4 flights, and the lounges are all of good and solid quality. Slept fine in Pride Lounge in Nairobi where I spent an eve and a night. Effective boardings/deboardings by either bus, on foot, or by jetbridge. Onboard, welcome champagne available on all four flights. I had prebooked seat 1A which was given me throughout. I preordered my favorite seafood meals which were delivered and tasty. The sole exception was a morning flight, where they could not manage my seafood, despite it appeared in their flight manuscript; not a big issue, but they apologised. KQ always manage special meals effectively; this is really a perk that not even legacy carriers like Qatar Airways or KLM allows for. The crews on all flights were fine, professional, caring, and in good mood. The food is getting better on these regional flights, and I had my tasty hot mini-meals served throughout. Hot towels provided. Nut mix were provided as snacks provided to assist on drinks, which were served several times. The challenge of my trip was the seemingly unusual turn-around in EBB to which airport staff were confused as I instantly returned to my origin without going landside. They allowed me not to buy a transit visa, and escorted me to transfer security and thereafter negotiated excessive spending time in lounge for me – I was granted full access for 7 hours though the airline agreement was only 3 hours.

I had an absolutely dreadful experience with KLM Airlines, and I feel compelled to warn others. First, they delayed the delivery of my baggage, leaving me stranded without my belongings for days. To make matters worse, when my luggage finally arrived, it was damaged beyond repair. The lack of care and accountability is shocking! Their customer service is the absolute worst – unhelpful, dismissive, and utterly lacking in honesty. They made promises to resolve the issue but did nothing. I was constantly redirected, ignored, and left in limbo with no resolution in sight. It felt like they couldn’t care less about their customers. KLM’s operations are disorganized, their communication is non-existent, and their treatment of passengers is unacceptable. I do not recommend this airline to anyone.

I went to italy after finally settling my divorce after 2 years. I went to be with a friend who after 4 of the 7 days ditched me. Mind you she was my translator and lived in italy and my guide around the city. So when she left on day 4 I was left to figure things out on my own. Mean less to say things only got worse. I tripped and fell on day 5, smashed my glasses into my eye cut my face up around my eye bled really bad and walked 2.5 km back to apartment with no help. Few days later i get on this flight back home.. i was so ready to go home, bruised and battered literally by life and my vacation and was expecting nothing but the worse of a flight back home. To my surprise i got on flight DL9418 on January 18th @ 06:30 am local time and it was very pleasant. The plane was nicer than the one i arrived in. I sat in my seat and it was very spacious and the pilot got us in the air quickly. Then here is where i think KLM stepped up from other flights i have been on. Including over delta. The two flight attendants were very kind. Most people avoided me with a cut up eye and bruised eye. I am 6'3 and about 280 lbs. So i am sure i am little intimidating and with a cut and bruised eye i understand. But these ladies were very concerned about my well being and if i had a good trip. Keep in mind i am not anything special. I am below average guy so it was genuine concern and care these ladies had. The brunette was very sweet and came back with a special meal and said i brought this for you. Also made sure i had drinks throughout the flight and wanted to make sure at least one thing went well on my trip. And i must say, she succeeded. Even as i left she wished me well as i left. In a week of failures, i at least felt good for few hours in the one day and i would suggest to anyone flying from BLQ to AMS to try to give KLM a try as the service I had that day was exceptional. If they provide this service across the board, they will continue to have great success and I will be glad to tell me story to others. For the money i spent that week and the bad week i had, the 2 hour flight made everything seem not as bad as it once was.

13621,13621,KM Malta Airlines,1,"""service is shockingly bad""",21st September 2024,False,"  I spent a fantastic week exploring Malta. Then I flew Malta airlines to Munich (KM0308 19Sept 1540) to catch a connecting flight home, and what appalling service and attitudes I received from two individuals of the cabin crew. My seat was economy class and being 2 metres tall did not fit into it. One other passenger next to me was equally tall and the passenger next to him was shorter but much larger. Immediately I realised that I did not fit in this seat I asked a stewardess (name unknown) that if a seat with more leg room was unoccupied if I could please move to it. She agreed. My two larger passengers seated themselves. Along came a steward who said the this was not good to have 3 big guys seated together (or words to that effect). He called the chap next to me and indicated for him to come so that he could be seated in an emergency exit seat. I spoke to the stewardess who had promised me a seat, and she immediately spoke to the steward, who gruffly over-rode her with not even a glance or an apology to me. Subsequently the oversized chap was also moved to the front of the craft in business, a seat with legroom. A short while later, I asked stewardess very politely if the pilot would be trying to make up time as we left 40 minutes late from Malta International Airport and I was concerned about my connecting flight. It was my previous experience that this was common practice with late flights. She said that she would ask the pilot. She went about her duties, serving meals and refreshments to business class and the pilots in the cockpit. She entered the cockpit on three occasions that I saw. Being a 2hr 30min flight the cabin staff were quickly finished their duties and were then standing around talking to each other. At no time did the stewardess come to me to answer my query. At some time later, I saw a uniformed officer (pilot?) exit the cockpit to speak to the cabin staff, at which time I left my seat to ask the pilot myself what our landing time was. One cabin staff who saw me approach the kitchen, angrily and aggressively closed the curtain on me to stop my interaction with the pilot who had entered the toilet. Since I too need the toilet I waited outside the curtain. When the pilot had re-entered the cockpit, she opened the curtain to allow me access to the toilet. Before going in, I asked her about this flight and our estimated landing time to which she promptly stated we would land at 18h10 as per the schedule. We actually landed 18:27. The air stewardess felt no shame in blatantly lying to me. The rudeness, arrogance and disdain for passengers that the two individuals above showed me I have never before experienced from cabin staff in the 35 years that I have flown internationally. The blatant contempt they show for passengers other than business class is astounding. I had heard from people that I spoke to about Malta airlines that if possible I should avoid flying this airline as the planes are old and service is shockingly bad, but with the airline partnerships prevalent at smaller destinations this was not possible. Further, looking out my window I saw what was clearly corrosion on this very old aircraft (see attached pics). I will be sharing my review far and wide as these individuals and the training they clearly don't receive from this airline might assist others in avoiding this treatment.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240919_182537-01-1-500x500.jpg,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Malta to Munich,September 2024,1.0,1.0,,2.0,,,1.0,no,neutral,0.5263300538063049,6.862662315368652,wing

Leg room was good and the IFE was a huge upgrade compared to what I usually experience when flying KE. There were a myriad of choices, primarily Western and Korean films and TV shows. I watched a few episodes of Friends. One notable thing that stood out on this flight was the degree of attention the cabin crew displayed by discerning which passengers needed immigrations cards for Korea based on citizenship so as to not disturb passengers in this late night flight.

My seat became defective as the recline lever wouldn’t return the seat back to its upright position, but kept reclining. The steward attempted to rectify it, but the problem only repeated once I reclined after meal service.

Those seated at the window can access the aisle via a narrow passage so that he doesn’t need to disturb the aisle seat passenger. As it was a red eye flight, the meal service was breakfast. I choose the Korean style breakfast of congee with condiments. The seat was wide and comfortable and fully reclining. There was a privacy divider between seats which you can use if your neighbour is a stranger. The cabin crew were efficient and friendly. At the end of the flight, the cabin manager came around to ask each Prestige Class passenger whether he enjoyed the flight. I have to point out some lapses in service which I hope that KE can address. Before landing, cabin crew did not go around to ensure that passengers lifted up the window shades. There was no way for non-Korean citizens to pre-order and pay for duty-free items for collection on board. I had to contact Sky Shop via Kakao messenger to place the order and make payment on board. I believe that this is something that KE should seriously look into as KE is an international company.

Annoying with face masks - only airline I’ve had to wear it for the last year or more. Next leg; Incheon to Auckland I was apparently downgraded to lower class. Prestige is not just prestige; you have to be sure that you have Prestige Suites all the way, because now I had a wide leaning chair, that was too narrow and too short to really rest well - and it didn’t go flat. Even worse; during the little sleep I managed to get, I was woken up twice by the stewardess, because my face mask was not positioned right?

This positive experience continued at the boarding gate where the gate agents greeted me with a warm welcome and forgiveness despite my late arrival possibly causing the flight to be on the brink of delay.

There's also Shin ramen for those who would like to enjoy a mid flight snack. I also have to give a shout out to the hardworking cabin crew that were vigilant about anticipating pax needs and for defining great hospitality. This other point may not be all that relevant for most, but I found their inflight magazine to be top notch! Not riddled with useless advertisements and boring content, but with excellent editorial pictures of destinations and useful travel tips. Conversely, this is really minor, but compared to major global carriers, the lack of entertainment choices and Wi-Fi is the airlines weak point. Still got to watch a few good flicks though.

There are few positives throughout the journey, but more negative aspects, will make me think twice before choosing this career again. Aircraft is brand new, maintained in pristine condition. Online checkin experience can be better, no clear steps of how to proceed. First time users, good luck with the process. but won’t complaint. Checkin at the airport was quick and can’t expect anything more. Boarding process can be improved, as there were no clear instructions for the lines. People were impatient and it was a mess. I was traveling JFK-Kuwait-Chennai (KU118). On time flight left the gate, probably since it’s weekend and peak hours we were taxiing for more than 30 mins. This delayed the departure quite badly. Snacks served right after take off, food was very good. Snack and Brunch menu have many options for vegetarians and kids as well. Crew were very friendly and was available to help the needy people. In my flight onboard WiFi was available. It is not free and it’s pay per use. $10-30mins, $20-60mins, $40-180mins. -Kuwait International airport, very unorganized arrival security and transit procedures. One staff handling the entire crowd and verifying the boarding pass. Airport have free WiFi, can be used to get in touch with dear ones. Transit, airport is under construction. You need to find the way around things and figure out on your own. Transit lounges are available, if there is a bigger layover (my case flight delayed by 3hours) you should use the facility. It’s free and has lot of seats. Connection flight, boarding again another chaos. Until last minute no clear information about the boarding gates. Once announced (literally one ground staffed shouted, no proper PA system) all the people came running to the gates. Could have been organized better. Since everyone came in random order, it took lot of time to settle down. Baggage, it could be the time of the day, but almost took one hour for collecting the bags. With the lean crowd, officials were not organized and bags in random order. Overall I will not recommend this carrier for family trips, if you are alone and want an adventurous trip then go for it.

Before booking, I had read many reports about the improved Kuwait Airways and unbeatable price. I was unsure what to expect. The check-in was a breeze at JFK and the agent said it was a light flight with about 35-40% load factor. That was surprising being just a day before Eid. Boarding was easy, and the aircraft pushed back 15 min before schedule. JFK-KWI flight, the aircraft very clean and seats comfortable. Legroom was fantastic. I managed to get a window seat and had all the three seats to myself. Rather almost everyone in the aft cabin had 3 seats to themselves. Individual TV screen was very responsive with a decent collection of programming. The crew was friendly and courteous. Menus, blanket, and basic amenity pouch handed out. Food was ok but can improve in quality. Was concerned about the short 45 min connection in Kuwait, but the flight arrived about an hour early. Kuwait airport is medieval and dirty with a few coffees and duty-free shops. Security checks are not centralized but occur at each gate leading to long lines and delays. My KWI-DXB flight (B 777-300 ER) was packed and was delayed more than an hour due to long lines at gate security. The short flight was uneventful and were handed out in a takeaway Iftar meal boxes. So, an in all a rather good flight. Return leg: DXB-KWI (A320) was short and uneventful with breakfast boxes handed out. KWI-JFK via Shannon was painful with an 85% load. Long security lines at the gate in Kuwait. One of the Kuwaiti pax who I chatted with was like - this flight is always delayed. Multiple security checks and verifications. Lotta connecting passengers mostly from South Asia and some of them didn’t know the flight had a stopover at Shannon. Lunch served, and amenity kits handed out. My choice of meal had run out but was nothing great. All pax deplaned at Shannon to go through multiple hellish security points and get back in about 2 hrs. It just gave time to stretch and use the toilets. Cabin crew was cheerful and courteous but I asked for blankets and was told none remain, however at the time of deplaning at JFK found an open overhead bin full of blankets.

You’re offered one drink and then maybe a digestive later, but nobody comes around offering you more and more like a standard international business class cabin. If you’re willing to go to the galley and ask they will give it to you. Sine La Compagnie sells their business class tickets at 1/3rd or less than a standard carriers I’m guessing they make some of the margins up here. I paid $1,500 for a round trip ticket with a flat bed. The lounge in Paris is pretty good. Good offerings. Nice drinks. Definitely worth 30 minutes of your time. Don’t both with the one at Newark.

Later, walked down to the gate, no one waiting, straight on board into a seat that’s like a lazy boy recliner. Greeted and served by the friendliest staff. Served fresh foods and cheeses. Woke up in NYC feeling great. Even the travel times were good, keeping us out of rush hour in NYC. Inbound: Got a text of a delay. At airport, after a bit of a wait, the CEO came down to inform of cancellation. We were taken to the nearby Ramada Inn, given rooms and food. Next day, we were visited at the hotel, again, in person by the CEO and his sales manager.

I recently flew with Latam Airlines on Flight LA3354 in Premium Economy, and it was an utterly disappointing experience. From the lack of organization during check-in to an unexpected filming activity onboard, the journey fell far short of what one would expect. The unannounced filming not only invaded passengers' privacy but also caused a significant delay in our flight, disregarding our time and schedules. The crew's activities created a distressing atmosphere, and issues with seat functionality added to the discomfort. Moreover, the delay in service due to staff involvement in filming left passengers confused and dissatisfied, with no clear explanation or resolution from the airline. Despite reaching out to Latam Airlines for a resolution, the response has been lacking. It's disheartening when an airline fails to address such grievances promptly and adequately.

Turns out Latam are greedy, dishonest, and incompetent as their online rep and twitter account both disregard your complaint and claim they wont cover the hotel since the flight was turned back due to weather.

What I would like to outline is not the fact that I was eventually rebooked on an earlier flight (had a FlexPlus fare so it was assumed), but how the staff cared. The initial morning flight had to be delayed and aircraft promptly replaced for a smaller one due to crew sickness: the ground staff had to manage 80+ passengers, most of whom went on vacation with families and were missing their flight connections: they resolved the situation very efficiently (I assume it is not easy to find alternative flights when flying out from a small island in the middle of nowhere known for an awful weather) and remained kind during the process. And in the middle of this all, the check-in manager found me out from the crowd in the departure hall and personally presented me with a new boarding pass, thus, solving my own mess in addition to the problems they had on the plate.

The flight attendant moved passengers around the the cabin to ensure ""balance"". It felt quaint and reminded me of the many Saab 340 flights I had taken from Detroit to Marquette (MQT) on Northwest Airlines (before Delta once it acquired Northwest retired them and replaced with CRJs). The actual flight time was less than 30 minutes and the views of the country side, the indented coastlines, and the landing over the waters were a pleasure to behold. The sole flight attendant ensured that safety rules were communicated and followed. She was dressed in the red and black tartan uniform, the colors of this Scotland based airliner. No food or drink service on this wee plane on this short flight. Given the limited space in the cabin, even carry on bags, had to be checked in. No charge. Check in at the Glasgow and Islay airports (for the return) were smooth and went off without a glitch. The alternate to the flights would have been a very long and ardous car/bus drive followed by a ferry crossing lasting for another at least over a couple of hours.

I took the LOT flight for the first time in 4 and a half years. Before boarding, I knew LOT’s long-haul business class seat remains unchanged from my previous flight. That was why I thought I could get a tight sleep on a fully lie-flat bed despite no privacy around it. Something strange happened, however. The story is as follows. LO80 departs from NRT at 22:50. After taking off, I reclined my seat to the lie-flat position and fell asleep. In a couple of hours, I woke up. Surprisingly, I found my cell phone missing. I searched for it for 15 minutes but in vain. A neighbor advised me to ask for some help from a flight attendant and I followed her advice. In the meantime he came. He adjusted back my seat to the original position and took off the seat cushion deftly. I felt relieved that he had salvaged it from deep inside. It fell through a gap produced while I was reclining it. I aver this kind of happening is not rare because my neighboring passenger on the returning flight suffered from the same situation. Needless to say, I suggested that he ask for a flight attendant. I learned that those seats LOT still offers have a fatal flaw, that is, almost no storage room. As far as an in-flight meal goes, I propose that Japanese meal be avoided. I also remember that a female attendant looked a little puzzled when I requested an individual dinner the trouble mentioned above. They may not be accustomed to taking individual care of business class passengers. No Wi-Fi service is available, on the other hand, the in-flight entertainment is limited. That said, LOT is still attractive in that they have the extensive network in Central and Eastern Europe whose hub is Warsaw Chopin Airport and the round-trip business class fare presented by LOT between Japan and Europe is two-thirds of ones by JAL and ANA.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG20240830105552-500x500.jpg,Boeing 789,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Tokyo Narita to Warsaw ,August 2024,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,1.0,,4.0,yes,neutral,0.8982287645339966,6.485342502593994,television
14690,14690,LOT Polish Airlines,9,“a great flight with LOT”,28th June 2024,True," This was not my first time flying with LOT, and any previous flights with them has been quite good. This one was no exception, I therefore wanted to write this review. To give them a little credit. Firstly, the booking site has gone through some upgrades since last time, something that I was very happy to see. The ticket price was also not that bad (for a legacy airline), and cheaper than KLM or Lufthansa I could have flown on this route. As far as I am concerned you can find affordable prices on LOT even a few days prior to departure. The price you pay and the value you get on board LOT is also comparable, and in my opinion much better than other large European legacy carriers. For example: - I was offered to check in my carry-on baggage free of charge at the check-in counter, something that was a pleasant surprise - You actually get a decent onboard complimentary service, even on the domestic part of the journey, with several drinks for you to choose, and a savoury or sweet bun. - Comfortable and spacious seat with power outlets and a decent recline but I have to admit that there were things that could be better: - We had a bus-boarding in both Wroclaw and in Warsaw. That is of course nothing special, especially in the rush-hours at polish airports. However, all the passengers from an Embraer was squished into a small bus, something that wasn’t exactly comfortable in 30*C. I would have expected that on Ryanair or Wizzair, but I have to admit that I was a little surprised that this was a normal procedure at LOT too. And of course, I can’t wait for LOT to get their new planes, as they really could need a little upgrade to make the overall experience even better. All in all, a great flight with LOT, highly recommended.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_4779-500x500.jpeg,Embraer 195,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Wroclaw to Oslo via Warsaw,June 2024,4.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,4.0,,5.0,yes,positive,0.9226462244987488,8.078481674194336,packet

After another 25 minutes spent in a plane - still no air condition - some passengers started to complain on shortness of breath. Cabin crew offered them water. Departure was delayed approximately 20 minutes. Aircraft in a very basic version, typical for low cost carriers. No entertainment system, no WiFi. Uncomfortable narrow seats, very small, dirty, sticky table. After take off a modest breakfast was served on a tray. Beef goulash or chicken cutlet - quite strange choice for breakfast? The meal was followed by tea, coffee, drinks, red and white wine (cheap house option). Other alcoholic beverages were available for sale. There was one toilet in front of the plane for 6 premium class passengers and two toilets in the back for 180 economy passengers. The flight was 6 hours 20 minutes. Can you imagine this queue to economy toilets?  Ladies from cabin crew were focused on safety belts and their make up mainly, incidentally were really rude to some customers. Before landing in Warsaw a mystery pie and drinks were offered. The pie was covered with foil with no description. Arrival at destination airport was 25 minutes delayed.

The LOT staff on arrival, in the Warsaw airport, were very friendly and helped me with the transfer directions so I managed to reach my gate very quickly. Then the staff which onboarded us were also of big help since I wasn't sure my luggage would fit in the plane so they proposed to handle my baggage without any additional costs. It was probably my best experience with a budget/low-cost airline so far. The previous flight from KIV to WAW > HAM was also fine and it was my first life experience with transfer flights. It's nearly impossible to get lost in that airport, especially with so many crew members around, you can always find someone to ask for help. (even the stewardess dropping some sparkling water on me during the flight to HAM wasn't an issue). The only negative would be maybe the luggage space in the aircraft and the relative small space for your feet between seats (I'm 190 cm high).

By that I mean a small backpack that I was able to fit a laptop and a few clothing items and toiletries in. Nobody batted an eye at the boarding gate to give me a tag either way. The crews on board [4 different crews] and at the ticket counter in both Vancouver and Hamilton were fantastic. By that I mean really awesome! There was only water served on the YCC to YHM Leg. There are no USB ports or films to watch, so bring your own. All of this information is clearly outlined in the mini emails you will receive. I had only a boarding pass on my phone and that was fine as well. The flight leaving was on time, but we were 1.5 hours delayed returning because of the delayed inbound flight.

Flying from Toronto to Phoenix and back was a breeze at such an affordable price. The plane left on time (maybe delayed by a few minutes) but then arrived earlier than expected so it all came out in the wash. I was curious about trying Lynx as there are so many mixed reviews but the cost was enticing (even with having to pay for carry on bags and a seat it still cost less than any other direct flight). Granted that there is no power outlets, no wifi, no entertainment, no food/drink (aside from water) but the planes were super clean, flight attendants were great and the flight was smooth. I knew what I was getting into with the absence of certain amenities but the price definitely reflects that. What I was expecting was a dusty old rickety plane with terrible service and hours or days of delays. What I got was the polar opposite.

The lead crew manager in particular stood out, helping the team with economy class drink service even after finishing their duties in business class. This showed impressive leadership and teamwork. During the meal service, the crew team carefully put ice in the cup. They remember my request. As the economy class toilet is full of passengers, the lead crew member guides me to use the business class toilet.  The announcement is very clear with a warm feeling of hospitality in dual languages. I ordered a special non-vegetarian meal on my flight, and I was thoroughly impressed. The chicken dish with Malaysian sauce was delicious - I would rate the meal quality as 5-stars.The boarding process is smooth and well organized.  The web-check in is easy to use. My flight is from Bangkok to Singapore via Kuala Lumpur. I can get two digital boarding passes from digital check-in without any system issues. The auto-checkin feature is available too. This aircraft does not have IFE as it is a 2 hours 20 mins short haul flight. However, all passengers can connect to MH studio by their own devices. There are many entertainment selections from movies, TVs. The only reason I don't rate five star is to compare with Singapore Airlines, Emirates, and those global premium carriers that provide IFE for all flights.

The tray table could be pulled out from under the armrest. A small pop-out tray for drinks did not seem sturdy enough in case of turbulence. No seat back TVs. Instead is the personal electronic device (PED) shelf clips open to hold your phone or tablet. Having been used to seat back monitors, I just could not be bothered to go through the process of connecting to Malaysia Airlines Studio streaming entertainment.

However, I booked the ticket on the Malindo website. I could simply operate that extra allowance service online if the system did not occur such a mistake. Plus it takes 10 mins to wait in a queue to talk to the CS every time and the phone line is so unstable! Such a waste of time and money. However, before departure, I called in to buy the allowances and the customer service lady told me I could only clear the payment at the Taipei office or at the airport. So I asked the lady the opening hours at the office in Taipei and proceeded to pay for it. When I arrived at the office, the office was closed and obviously routinely away during weekends. Then I called again to ask whether I could simply clear the payment at the counter when check-in despite the paying-4-hours-before-departure policy. I was in Taipei when I made the call about six hours away before departure and I got my transportation to the airport all booked already. The airport is in Taoyuan. Therefore it was a bit of inconvenience for me to present myself 4 hours before departure just to clear the payment. I told the CS lady that I did want to purchase extra allowance in advance and made my actions to pay for it and all those showed that it was not a sudden decision. Anyhow, the CS lady insisted still I had to pay off the fees four hours before departure even after consulting with her manager. She sort of accused me that if I operated it online 48 hours before departure I could have paid it online despite that I tried to tell her it was not working even before 48 hours. This whole thing was really inefficient and highly unfriendly to customers. If you can make a remark about how many KGs I intend to buy, why can not Malindo simply make a remark allowing me to pay off the bill while checking in? Make passengers/customers to go to the airport  4 hours in advance just to clear the bill is pure nonsense. As my first experience with Malindo Air, it turned out to be the worst and the service was blunt. Firstly, the online ticketing system was poorly designed and considered my transaction done with an OTA. Secondly, the CS lady provided me false information and made me go to the local office that was always closed during weekends. Thirdly, the payment policy was so inflexible and unfriendly. Even worse, when I finished the flight with Malindo I found out my luggage was heavily damaged. And the goods in another check-in were also terribly hit. I've flown regularly but my luggage has never been treated that way with such strong force.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Baggage_broken-part--500x500.jpg,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Taipei to Brisbane via Kuala Lumpur,February 2020,1.0,3.0,,1.0,1.0,,1.0,no,negative,0.6389293074607849,4.656261444091797,waste container

I am writing to formally express my frustration and disappointment with the way my flight cancellation was handled. Firstly, my flight was canceled without any prior notice via email or phone, either to me or my travel agency. Upon arriving at the airport, I found that several managers were present, yet none of them seemed to know what to do. When I informed them that my family and I needed to reach Bangalore urgently for our New Year celebrations the next day, they showed little concern or willingness to assist. After repeatedly going back and forth between different offices and waiting for answers, I was finally told that Nepal Airlines could only fly us to Mumbai, and from there, we would have to arrange our own travel to Bangalore. This was shocking and unacceptable, but since we had no other option, we had to agree. Upon arriving in Mumbai, I learned that Nepal Airlines had arranged connecting flights for some U.S. passengers from Mumbai to Bangalore, while leaving most of us stranded without any support. I attempted to contact Nepal Airlines but my calls were ignored. I also sent messages via WhatsApp, which were seen but not responded to. When I finally managed to speak to someone, I was blamed for going to Mumbai, and was told that because of this, the airline would not book us a connecting flight. This response was shocking and completely unacceptable. Due to Nepal Airlines’ failure to provide proper assistance, I had to book my own flight from Mumbai to Bangalore at a high cost, with no compensation or refund. I urge Nepal Airlines to take responsibility for this situation and provide a refund for my additional expenses, as well as an explanation for the poor handling of this issue.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_3433-500x500.jpeg,,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Kathmandu to Bangalore,February 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,negative,0.7761935591697693,5.6766510009765625,abacus

Both times the plane was quite new and clean inside, haven't seen anything broken. This time my seat (which I chose online in advance) was closer to the back of a cabin, and the noise levels were comparable to a jet aircraft, certainly quieter than ATR72 despite the higher speed. The seats are reasonably comfortable (for a regional flight) and with enough legroom. There were no meals (it's LCC anyway), however they provide small bottles of water for free, which is nice. The flight to Chiang Mai took exactly 1 hour and arrived 10 minutes ahead of schedule - no longer than a jet could take, but more eco-friendly. And the price I've paid (promo + 15 kg baggage, booked 12 days in advance) was not much more than for a bus, which would take 12 hours. Definitely will fly again, especially as Nok Air covers more destinations than any other Thai airline, including some small airports no one else flies to.

First impression is that the airline is really cute, the whole ‘bird’ theme stuck throughout, the planes are painted in different colors and the nose always has a beak. This theme was also present in the cabin service - the stewardesses wore yellow and all the materials were really well thought out to present the brand image. As a PR person this is refreshing - especially from a budget airline. Seat pitch was quite tight, however in general it was comfortable. The service was slightly better than other popular budget airlines brands in Asia. The stewardesses came only once after the seatbelt lights were turned off; and dimmed the cabin lights for us to sleep.

After service began it turned out that you had to order your meal in advance. Since we did it through a third party we did not know that. Our bad. We asked if we can pay on board. No! So your options are only squashed, awfully tasting, weird looking kind of sandwich for $10.50 or Noodles that you buy at the supermarket for less than $1 for $6. In case you don't have a card with you, you can't even get water! Everything else that you may need for a transatlantic flight is available only for a heavily overpriced fee.

I have flown low cost airlines (AirEuropa, WizzAir, RayanAir, Norwegian and so on) but I have never seen such things. So a piece of advice from a regular traveler - even do the ticket price seems reasonable, after paying for your essential needs, the price becomes more expensive than regular airline so save yourself some time, inconveniece and disappointments.

However, I was approached by a flight attendant who demanded an additional $50 for the seat. Overall, the experience was extremely disappointing, and I ended up paying significantly more than anticipated. I strongly advise against purchasing tickets from Norse Airlines to avoid such issues in the future.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/IMG_-20240529_162710-500x500.jpg,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Gatwick to Los Angeles,May 2024,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,,1.0,no,negative,0.8713809847831726,7.5315375328063965,clogs
15928,15928,Norse Atlantic Airways,2,"""utterly disappointing experience""",28th May 2024,True,"  My recent experience with Norse Airlines was deeply disappointing and marred by poor customer service and exorbitant fees. Traveling from JFK to Gatwick plus the return flight I encountered numerous issues that made this journey one of the worst I have ever experienced, especially given the stressful circumstances of attending my mother’s funeral. First and foremost, the carry-on baggage policy was appalling. Despite trying to check in online (it’s not available) and noting the carry on bag fees of $80, we were shocked to be charged $130 per carry-on at the airport since our carry on bags exceeded the 22lbs limit, ours were 23, 24 and 29lbs. First we were forced to place our bags (which are officially sized carry on suitcases) in the metal sizing machine, which crushed them and scratched them pretty badly, only to be told they all exceeded the 22-pound weight limit. This resulted in an additional cost of nearly $400 to check our carry-ons—bags that we have carried on multiple international flights without issue. To add insult to injury, there was plenty of overhead space on the plane, making the forced baggage check feel like a blatant money grab, since the weight is the weight whether in the overhead or in the cargo hold. Moreover, the seat selection fees were another expense. We ended up paying an extra $60-$100 per seat to ensure our family could sit together. When tallying these costs and the ridiculous carry-on charges, our savings compared to other  airlines dwindled to just a few hundred dollars. The in-flight experience did nothing to redeem the initial frustrations. My onboard food was inedible, including the vegetarian option. This only added to our dissatisfaction and discomfort during the flight. Overall, this journey with Norse Airlines was a nightmare from start to finish. From the extortionate baggage fees and poor customer service (at the airports) to the subpar in-flight experience, it was a far cry from the smooth travel experience we had hoped for. Given the additional wait times at both JFK and Gatwick at baggage claim, along with the cumulative extra costs, I honestly regret not choosing another airline. This was an utterly disappointing experience during an already distressing time in my life, and one I will never forget.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IMG_3651-500x500.jpeg,,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,New York JFK to Gatwick,May 2024,3.0,4.0,2.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,no,negative,0.8821734189987183,5.4437737464904785,airliner

Very nice flight attendants. I can only praise them. Both flights (LGW to LAX and return) left on time and both arrived more than half an hour early. Compared to Norwegian, food quality was about the same (satisfactory to good). But in-flight entertainment was deceiving: there was no map or info about where we were, except altitude, outside temperature, and ETA. This was frustrating since this is what I like most to watch. One could see also that the ex-Norwegian 787s need some maintenance regarding the seats: the screen was difficult to deploy from the armrest with a lot of squeaking and was not adjustable to a good horizontal position.

We contacted customer service and they refused to provide a refund and informed us those were the rules. This equated to an additional €50 on top of our flight cost with no possible recourse.

They then returned and informed us that our flight was on the next gate to where we where going to dock. They moved my husband and myself just prior to landing to 2 free seats at the front so that we would be able to leave the plane first. When the cabin door opened they called our names and told us how to get to the gate, we ran as fast as we could to the gate, and they where waiting for us, because they had been informed that we where on our way.

Domestic Muscat to Salalah and return on Oman Air in early April. It is not easy to give a star rating for this trip. On the one hand, the two 1h-flights left and arrived on time. Ground handling was swift and friendly throughout, as were the flight attendants. Seats on the 737-800 were reasonably comfortable, and there was a modern touch screen (which I used only for the very good map and flight info functions). On the other hand and unfortunately as usual with Oman Air, cabin announcements were utterly unintelligible.

16481,16481,Pacific Airlines,1,"""never had such a bad experience"" ",9th October 2023,True,"   As one of previous reviewers I realized, that instead of Vietnam Airlines my flight is operated by Pacific Airlines only at check in counter in airport. Yes, it was my fault and next time I will never choose flight operated by Pacific Airlines. First of all, their staff was not that polite with customers. They were not rude, but were not giving a heck to them. Then they show their unprofessionalism. I was flying with my wife. We had 2 bags and we didn't have scales to make sure both bags have equal weight. I asked staff not to send the 1st bag until we check weight of the 2nd one, because we are not sure if the 2nd one is below limit in 23 kg. But, as I said, staff was not giving a heck and of course she sent our 1st bag further. And 2nd bag was 25 kg. So, we had to stay for half an our waiting for staff to find and bring our bag back. When they bring my bag, I found out that they torn away one of handles. Handle was not just damaged but literally torn away one of mounts of handle. So, there is no way to mount it back, because there is a hole in bag with size about 2x5 cm. They said I can write complain at the airport when I arrive. When I arrived, I came to their room. They offered me 150.000 vnd (6$). My bag was just 1 year old and I bought it for 65$, so of course I refused. I wrote complain. After some time they answered me that ""they have rule"" to compensate for broken handle 6$ only. No matter if your bag is 10$ or 300$. So, they think that 6$ is enough to compensate damage. Which bag can you buy for 6$? Will you be able to fix bag for 6$? Of course no. It simply doesn't have area where to mount handle (they torn it away). I was trying to explain them that this compensation is absolutely not fair and they should either compensate real damage, either replace broken bag with similar new one. But they simply don't give a sh*t. As a result - they broke my bag, I had to throw it away and they didn't compensate more than 6$. Normally I never write negative feedbacks, but I've never had such a bad experience with any air company I used before (though I used quite a lot). Absolutely terrible and unprofessional service. I will neve ever use their service again and I strongly recommend you to avoid them, if you don't want to have uncompensated damage from their staff.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1696404168902-500x500.jpg,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Da Nang to Ho Chi Minh,September 2023,3.0,3.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no,negative,0.8260251879692078,5.443753719329834,wallet

16596,16596,Pegasus Airlines,1,"""first time I missed my flight""",12th September 2024,True,"   We were travelling from Paris to Saint-Petersburg with an overnight transfer in Istanbul. The morning we arrived back to the Sabiha Gokcen airport, we found it way too overcrowded. Luckily, as we thought then, we had our baggage checked in and only needed to cross the border and pass the security control. The navigation in the airport is confusing, and we took the wrong line serving only the Turkish citizens. The border security officer refused to let us through and sent us to another line. After the security check, we finally saw the departure information screen. It said the gate is closing, in Turkish. We rushed to the gate and found no one at the desk. 20 minutes before the scheduled departure, they left it. This was the first time I missed my flight. Probably, the first time in my experience when the gate was closed so soon, too. As instructed, we went to the Pegasus office. The office is a tiny desk with only one person actually doing something. We spent whole two hours there just to get through the line, or more like a crowd, with lots of Turkish people swearing and shouting at the staff.  There was no Pegasus representative to manage the crowd, there was no announcement, nothing. When we finally had a word with the person at the desk, he told us than the only thing he can help us with is buying another ticket for the next day at a full price. No refund, no discount, nothing. And he asked me to give him my credit card details: number, name, date and the security code to buy the new ticket. Now that's some mythological creature! I told him that it was a scam, and I could buy tickets from another company for the same day at a lower price. We were given the option to leave the airport and to do that we had to wait for some other Pegasus employee to guide us through the border control, that was another 30 minutes. Long story short, it's been 9 days and we still have no information about our baggage. We arrived to the Saint-Petersburg airport where, we thought, our baggage would be waiting for us. It turned out they take the baggage off the plane if you miss your flight. So, the airport is heavily overcrowded. 20 minutes before the departure, we are at the gate. It is closed and there's no one there. Pegasus representative at the nearby gate tells us that we need to go to their office. The  departure is delayed for 30 minutes, probably because they need to find the baggage and unload it. And then, no one tells us that we need to collect it before leaving the airport. When we arrived to Sabiha Gokcen from Paris, we saw a huge pile of bags and suitcases all over the baggage claim area. The pile was secured with a strap, branded Pegasus. So, today is the ninth day our suitcases are buried somewhere in that pile. There's no update to our lost baggage ticket, nothing.

I called Pegasus support, and they outright lied to me, claiming ""there was a reason for it,"" as if my luggage violated some rules. I argued that if that were the case, security would have confiscated it. That's when they told me to ""just leave your luggage and report it missing,"" before hanging up on me.

The inflight Chief Purser Mr Eric Mariano told us the non-functioning seat buttons problem was an ongoing issue with his airline and even though their staff had made numerous complaint reports of the seats not functioning, the airline had stubbornly not repaired them.

On our flight from Brisbane to Manila, only one flight attendant was polite with the customers. All the female flight attendants were rude and hitting the passengers arms with their food trolley. Not enough, we were not allowed to have the blinds open to have a view or read a book. For some reason it was mandatory to shut the window and the staff closed it for multiple passengers.  On our flight from Manila to Puerto Princesa another change on the departure time with ridiculous short notice. On our flight from Coron to Manila, another issue. Although we paid for extra luggage for my mother-in-law ($62), the lady who was doing our check in charged us AU$120 for over weight. Despite our attempts to explain that we had paid for extra luggage already and despite the fact that the attendant had very good comprehension of the English language, she dogly charged us once again for ""over weight"" luggage. On our flight from Manila back to Australia, 17/11 at 11:35pm, we received an email advising that our flight departure would be delayed for 18/11 at 4:30am. We would be waiting for our flight in the airport for almost 12h. We spoke with the attendants regarding providing us with an appropriate space to rest, like a lounge room, and to provide dinner for the passengers. Apart from laughing about the situation, the Philippines Airlines staff was not able to give us an answer for few hours. We ended up sleeping in the airport dirty floor and receiving a bottle of water and a bag of crackers as ""dinner"". Not enough, other passengers advised that they were back in the airport for the 3rd night in a role, as their flights were cancelled twice already. Furthermore, a flight to Perth was overbooked and the staff was begging passengers to volunteer to take another flight. The plane we flew from Manila to Brisbane (9h flight) was so old that the seats were not reclining and they didn't have a screen to watch a movie or a USB to charge our phones.

What they do have is a friendly crew and comfortable seats. I've used them twice now, once in 2023 and again in 2024. All flights were on time and problem-free. Some reviewers slam them for the low-cost model but if you understand what you're getting and plan ahead, this is a great airline that will get you where they fly at a significantly lower cost than other airlines.

Normally, we fly high-end airlines with all the alcohol, food, entertainment, pillows, blankets, and ear buds. For a sudden visit in mid-July, this was going to be a costly trip. Therefore, although we were full of much trepidation, we booked round trip flights from Washington DC to Glasgow via Reykjavik on this new game changing airline. Then, we read the reviews and fear struck. After reading the reviews we were full of doubts. We were just hoping to get there.  Four flights total. All flights were on time arriving ahead of schedule. The staff from initial check in to flight attendants and the pilot were all very enthusiastic, professional, and responsive to passengers. We could not have ask for anything more and will definitely fly Play again. And I must comment on the legroom and the comfort level of the seats. The planes are new and well designed with much more comfort and space than others. Plus we saved some money and had a great experience. My only advice is be prepared. Food and beverages are available for purchase in flight. Although the prices aren’t horrid, you can save some money by bringing your own food and snacks on the plane.

The short story is that they left us and our two small children stranded in NY at night with no plans, support or communication when our tickets were round trip to Baltimore. We are still fighting to get reimbursed for the cost of renting a car and driving to our actual destination. It was a total nightmare. Our flight home from Dub-Kef was delayed by over 3 hrs. Causing the 1 flight a day from Kef-bwi to be missed. We were given very little communication but eventually told that all missed connections were rebooked for the next day and passengers would be taken to a hotel. We went to the hotel and eventually late that night received an email with new flight info. So far, we kept a good attitude and considered it an adventure. However when we tried to check in for the flight we couldn’t and just got error messages. So we went to the airport the next day and we’re told that the new flight was overbooked! They offered us €700 to get bumped but said it could take up to 4 days to get rebooked and there weren’t any hotels available in town anyhow! So we declined and they finally said they put us on an Iceland air flight home. But when we got the booking email it was NOT to Baltimore it was to New York! The email said they were working on flights from New York to Baltimore and would email us when it was finished. The exact time the flight finished boarding, we received emails stating that they were unable to find connecting flights and we should “kindly find our own accommodations.” Upon landing in New York (where PLAY doesn’t have any agents) we were given no further help and told to file a claim on their web site. We had to pay our own way home. Now we are trying to get reimbursed but the communication doesn’t even make sense when they bother to reply at all. It’s like starting over every time someone replies.

We then realised we weren't alone in complaining about this. The staff were unsurprisingly unhelpful and told us it was in the T&C's.

17024,17024,Porter Airlines,1,“frustrating and deeply disappointing ordeal”,5th October 2024,False," I never actually got to fly with Porter Airlines—and perhaps their very short line-up at the check-in should have been my first red flag. With high hopes of exploring a new airline, I decided to try Porter for the first time, stepping away from my usual choice, WestJet, known for its phenomenal customer service. However, my journey with Porter never left the ground, quite literally, thanks to an encounter that turned into a frustrating and deeply disappointing ordeal. Porter Airlines, often praised for its upscale feel, was supposed to offer a smooth, comfortable travel experience. I had prepared in advance, booking my flight, checking in online, and paying for my luggage—all to save time at the airport. Yet, upon arriving at check-in with two bags and a carry-on, I was met with unexpected obstacles that quickly snowballed. When I discovered one of my bags was slightly over the 23kg limit, I was ready to pay the extra fee. However, the check-in agent suggested I rearrange my luggage instead, as the extra weight charge was ""too expensive"" at $105. Following her advice, I moved a few items, getting both bags within the acceptable range. This should have been the end of the story, but it was just the beginning of my troubles. Two other check-in agents then intervened, speaking to me in a condescending tone and escalating the situation unnecessarily. ""You don’t seem to understand,"" one of them snapped, without any provocation. Shocked by their rudeness, I tried to maintain calm, suggesting we restart the conversation respectfully. However, when I politely asked for their names, I was told, ""We don’t give out names. It’s our policy."" Things spiraled further when I decided to document the interaction by taking a photo. The supervisor, now irate, declared, ""You’re not flying with us today because you took a picture."" I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. My attempt to address the issue in a reasonable manner was met with threats and hostility, and they even called security on me. The 2 security staff who arrived showed more empathy than the airline agents, but by then it was too late. The damage was done. I had been told I wouldn’t be allowed to fly, and to make matters worse, I was pressured to delete the photos I had taken—photos that were simply my attempt to document a frustrating and unprofessional situation. What started as a simple baggage weight discrepancy had escalated into a power trip, and the lady saying I am the supervisor confidently stating, ""Let’s see what you’ll do."" The final insult came when Porter’s customer service marked my flight as a ""no show,"" despite the fact that I had been at the airport the entire time trying to resolve the issue. As a mental health advocate, I am keenly aware of how toxic experiences like this can affect one’s well-being. I was left feeling disrespected, and emotionally drained by the lack of professionalism and basic human decency shown by the Porter Airlines staff. Ultimately, I never got to board my flight. The experience was enough to make me swear off Porter Airlines for good. While they may have a reputation for providing a premium in-flight experience, their customer service on the ground was nothing short of appalling. If you're considering flying with Porter, beware. Sometimes the allure of trying something new leads to unexpected disappointment. My advice? Stick with an airline where respect and professionalism are the standard, not the exception. For me, that’s WestJet.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Screen-Shot-2024-10-05-at-8.50.51-AM-264x500.png,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Edmonton to Ottawa,October 2024,1.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no,negative,0.6675288081169128,-1.0,error

17042,17042,Porter Airlines,1,"""extremely disappointed"" ",1st July 2024,True,"   Currently writing this review while stranded in Boston. This was our first experience using Porter airlines and I am extremely disappointed. My flight was supposed to be at 4:55pm and we found out an hour before takeoff while sitting at the gate that the flight was cancelled. A representative never came to the gate, everyone from the flight was standing around confused with no answers or support trying to call Porter with no luck. We were put on hold for about an hour and finally an agent answered and told us that our flight had been rebooked for 11:20am the following day. We requested information related to a hotel voucher and we were told to go to the check in desk to get a distress coupon for a hotel. Upon arrival at the check in desk we were offered a cot to sleep on in the airport and a $15 food voucher and were told that if we wanted to stay in a hotel that would come at a cost to us out of pocket. The manager told us they are not required to do anything to help us and basically we are stranded in Boston for 18.5 hours with $15 towards food. We felt completely cast aside. Now we are trying to find a hotel to stay in and get our flight home tomorrow.

Booking with them was seamless, as was advance check-in and gate check-in. I did not have checked bags so cannot speak to that part of the experience but there was ample room in the overhead compartment for a standard carry-on bag and lots of room under the seat for personal items. Boarding after the usual assisted and family went by row, beginning with the rear of the plane. This made boarding quick, easy and everyone was seated a full 8 minutes before scheduled departure. Push back from the gate was precisely on time. The single-aisle plane has a 2x2 configuration, so no middle seats. The setback pockets were quite small with only enough room for a small bottle of water and a book. There is no in-seat entertainment, however, there is free wifi onboard to connect with movies, music, etc. and there is a power outlet for every seat. On a 4 hour flight, a variety of complimentary snacks and beverages were served twice, including domestic wine in an actual glass (classy). The plane was spotless and the seats were comfortable.

17054,17054,Porter Airlines,1,"""worst airline we’ve flown""",29th February 2024,True,"  My family (wife and 3 young kids) were supposed to fly from Orlando to Vancouver with a connection in Ottawa last week. The flight was late leaving Orlando so we missed our connection and had to get a hotel in Ottawa. They said they would hold the flight for us but our bags would not be on the flight so we would have to go back to yvr the next day to collect 5 huge suitcases which is 90 minutes away. So because we didn’t want to do this, they said it was our choice to not catch the flight to Vancouver at 8 pm Tuesday night. Not only did Porter lose our car seats already, (checked in as oversized) but the communication was very bad and they didn’t offer us a dime for any of these out of pocket extra costs (approx $400 CAD) The following morning we had to be up at 5 to make it to Pearson, before flying to yvr at 13:00. After sitting patiently at our gate for 4 hours, we knew our plane had still not arrived and it was getting close for our time to board, then 10 Minutes before our flight began to board they made an announcement that our gate had been changed our gate from b2a to B39 at Pearson which is quite the hike to make it to our gate. (With 5 backpacks and 3 young kids!) We were very sweaty once we finally got to the gate. We finally boarded at 12:30 and then we’re informed that our 13:00 flight departure would be delayed at least an hour for maintenance. We left the gate after 14:00. Once finally in the air we were informed by the attendant that with an hour still left in our flight the lavatories were full so no one could go to the washroom for that whole time. Very big ask for 3 kids on a 5 hour flight. This was our first time flying to Porter and we were so excited and hopeful that this would be a great experience.

17134,17134,Qantas Airways,1,"""more like a budget carrier""",28th February 2025,True,"   Sydney to Bangkok Economy on a Finnair wet leased by Qantas. A very disappointing experience from the start. Worst part of my holiday. In Sydney I had to use 2 different check-in kiosks to obtain my boarding pass due as the first had a software glitch and shut down together with an embarrassing red light on top. All of the check in kiosks were filthy despite 3 staffers nearby who could have been more helpful and wipe down the screens. The touchscreen function wasn't light touch, rather it required a pretty hard tap which was awful. In Bangkok it was also silly because despite the ticket saying to use the self-check in kiosk, there weren't any. Also Qantas did not give any info to let me know which departure gate to enter the airport (which happened to be near the very end of the terminal) Onboard both flights the carpet was visibly worn and frayed and the seats were stained. The cabin smelt stale the whole time. The toilets were dirty and there was no soap available. Food was more like a budget carrier than a full service. On the flight to Bangkok they even served chicken for 2 meal servings (lunch and dinner) rather than providing options like lamb or fish which was a poor oversight. Seats were terrible. I had no use of the armrest because the over-sized person nextdoor hogged it. Making things worse their leg spilled over more than halfway into my seat. The cabin crew did not intervene to help me. The IFE unit takes up legroom and underseat storage by about 2 inches across. The headphone socket is on the upper right of the seat in front and is easy to tangle up and trip over. It was also worn out and I had to put up with cackly reception or no sound most of the time. Entertainment content was awful. It was overtly repetitive with very limited genre on offer and much of it was repeats of certain actors or 'box set' series so it was like having the same movie multiple times or watching the same person multiple times. This made the length of the already long trip more of an ordeal. Just like their check in kiosks, the IFE swipe function required a pretty hard tap and even then some luck to get it to obey. Despite booking my seats well in advance on the return leg they switched my seat at the last minute and made no apology nor give any good reason or compensation despite being a long-standing customer. The staff onboard were not pleasant. They may have said 'please' and 'thank you' but it was not genuine nor welcoming. Eye contact wasn't natural or soft, it was intimidating. On one leg of the journey they let the passenger next to me handle items rather than handing them to me directly.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/no-space-2-500x500.jpg,A330,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Sydney to Bangkok ,February 2025,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no,negative,0.8785843849182129,6.056704521179199,limousine

Qantas lounge in Adelaide is under renovation and whatever those renovations end up as can only be an improvement. Food was limited to 2 choices of bland rubbish and the coffee was poor. Adelaide to Sydney (737) the service commenced over halfway through the flight and the food was very average. Economy class had all been served before drinks were offered in Business Class. Qantas Lounge in Sydney was ok. Food again was very limited and poor but at least the bar was open. Sydney to Cairns (737) was good with decent food and consistent topping up of drinks from attentive attendants. The flight being half full, if that, no doubt had an impact. Cairns to Adelaide via Brisbane. The morning flight was delayed by an hour which ended up being 2. The lounge in Cairns was marginally better than Adelaide with actual breakfast offerings but overall the Qantas lounge experience is poor to average. Mainly just poor. Cairns to Brisbane was on an Alliance E190 and the plane was filthy. There was rubbish from previous flight(s) in the seat pocket, under the seat and jammed between the seat and the wall. Additionally the floors did not look like they had been vacuumed for a long time and no other surface wiped down. The service was bad, late and poor quality. On descent into Brisbane passengers were advised of any connecting flight due to the significant delay. Our connecting flight was to be on the same aircraft and gate with a 'quick turnaround'. As such we (thought we) had no time to wait in the Qantas lounge and remained at the gate. The boarding time kept being pushed back every 15 minutes with the excuse of 'catering and cleaning' offered. On reboarding to the same seat the plane was in the same condition with the rubbish still in place. The catering was no different with the same garbage being served up and I had to use the call button for the first time in my life to get any response from the FA. Arrived home late I used to rate Qantas but their in flight service has gone substantially downhill, which appears to be a consistent theme in the reviews. Had I flown economy I wouldn't bother leaving a review because you get what you pay for. But these were 4 Business Class flights and overall they were a colossal waste of money. So there is no point flying domestic business. The extra few 1000 $ would go a long way in the airport proper Of note Qantas only requested a review of the Sydney - Cairns flight (the only one likely to elicit positivity). They clearly knew the other 3 would be slated so don't bother requesting a review which would balance out any internal ratings to 'lift your game or I'm going with the competition'.

17206,17206,Qantas Airways,2,"""a really disappointing airline""",29th January 2024,True,"  I was flying to Australia for the first time and I had a choice between China Eastern and Qantas. The experience was so bad. It felt so budget and grimey. 1. They emailed early on the day of the flight to say the entertainment system was broken and to prepare. This is crazy for a long haul flight and the plane came from Sydney so how could they not have addressed this issue before flying to China. So nothing worked. No movies, no map, no safety video. Also, on board they said people should download on Netflix knowing full well that Chinese people have no access to Netflix. So basically they ignored the problems Chinese people might face. The seats were one of the smallest I’ve ever sat on. It was so tight and the whole cabin felt cluttered and poorly laid out. In addition, the material of the pillow meant everything was sticking to it so it looked really gross and dirty. The toilets were also super gross and the whole experience felt unhygienic.  The meal was appealing I can barely put it into words. Usually I take a photo of my plane food as generally I like it. There was just one container of meat or veg or whatever you ordered and a piece of bread. No nice tray or cups or no presentation at all. The breakfast was the same. Really below expectations for a long haul flight. The plane left shanghai over 2 hours late. Nothing was offered for these 2 hours. The cabin crew were nice but quite inattentive. While waiting to go to the restroom, a Chinese lady asked for hot water. There were a lot of cabin crew and not one person helped her even though it was obvious was she needed and she asked. After about five minutes someone helped her. They seem to prioritize white people so if you fall into this category you’re lucky. I complained about my experience as it was so terrible and the flight wasn’t cheap. They offered my $100 travel credit which can be used on a future flight. I’m not from Australia and I have no plans to return in the near future so this isn’t really helpful. To conclude, Qantas is a really disappointing airline with a terrible service, dirty and compact cabins, poor food quality  I would never fly with them again. Fortunately after landing I had a good experience in Australia. It’s a shame that this airline is the first thing a lot of people will encounter when coming to Australia.

Our evening meals were a choice between spicy beef noodles, chicken salad and a vegetarian lentil shepherd pie. The spicy beef noodles looked like sludge and was not the best. All meals were served in a box, with a small piece of warm focaccia on a napkin. And that was it. Much later on, a Splice ice cream was handed out as dessert. Much more later on, the tea and coffee was served. You could help yourself to water at the water dispenser with very tiny cups. Best to bring your own water bottle to fill up. It was soon lights out. Whilst the lights were out, water and a small packet of soy crisps came by. Most people were asleep and literally in the dark so this service went unnoticed. Instead of back seat screens, tablets were supplied but there was insufficient quantity for all passengers. If you were not using it for any period of time, the flight attendant asked for it back. When we were preparing to land, request for the tablets to be removed from the back of the seats. One flight attendant roughly pulled mine out of its position and thrust it into the back pocket. Surprisingly she did not do it to 2 other persons sitting close by. If I had chosen a budget airline, my expectations would have been budget meals and service.

It is a quick flight between the 2 major regional cities in the north approx 45 min flying time cutting down around a 3 to 4 hour drive. There is no classes available and whilst you could select your seat it was on a first come first served basis. The plane was full only a few empty seats so no opportunities to move seats. It is mostly workers commuting between the cities or to connecting charter flights for mining We were slightly late on take off due to the catering being late. The catering company also failed to deliver the alcohol so they made the decision to leave without it. We did however land on time. I can't blame the airline for this but I was looking forward to having a glass of wine. They provided an inflight snack 'manna from heaven' which was a small box of 3 x bite sized snacks very tasty & your choice of soft drink. Considering the flight time was so short the cabin staff did well to serve the whole cabin & do a rubbish collection and then we were ready for descent The cabin crew were courteous and efficient but nothing jumped out to me as a WOW The cabin and seats themselves are very tight and not a lot of room. I would imagine it would very uncomfortable for a tall or large person ( i am only 5 ft ) especially of the flight was longer then 1 hour. The cabin was clean.

Whilst the flight was nice, I would only choose it if I was flying on a connecting Qantas flight afterwards as for a 1 hour 15-minute flight Jetstar still has better value for money. Great experience, but for double the price to Jetstar it's just not worth it if you value your money over a small increase in comfort. Seat: Comfortable with plenty of padding and support, but a bit narrow. However, its better than no padding at all (Jetstar). Legroom: Decent, but I wouldn't want to spend long in it, for someone who is 6' 1"", about an inch to spare. Cabin Crew: Helpful and polite, very professional and well kept. Kudos to QantasLink there. Food & Drink Served: As a morning flight (6:30 takeoff) a tasty scroll, juicy apple, some berries and a cup of tea were welcome and completely complementary. Aircraft Overall: The Boeing 717 is surprisingly quiet and is overall very nice to be on. As an aviation fan it has some very cool wing views from row 13,14 and 15, but for me I'd say the best are 16 and 17, as they have an awesome engine view. However, if you are not a plane nerd like myself, I would not recommend them as they are louder than the rest of the cabin. Quieter Seats are found forward of row 9. In Flight Entertainment: Whilst on-board WIFI and IFE is free for business travelers, economy passengers must rent IFE at an extra cost.

They engage in conversation with you about your trip as if they are genuinely interested in you enjoying your journey and they are happy that they get to be a part of the process. I also liked that you never have to repeat a request. They listen carefully and follow through even with things like ""Please wake me up 2 hours before we land"" and try their best to accommodate special requests. The team on board this particular flight was one of the best I have experienced. They worked in unison to deliver guest satisfaction. It felt like they actually liked each other and were happy. I want to specially mention Fares who was catering to my side of the cabin. He had a warm, engaging smile. He was attentive and professional. I enjoyed his mannerism and I noticed that he took time to make every single person in his aisle feel special. To conclude, the crew for other airlines are polite, yes, but on Qatar, I feel they are more than just robotic smiling.

The Rex domestic 737 fleets, as you may know already uses previous Virgin Australia planes, and the interior is essentially Virgin themed (Virgin colored head rests, bulkhead covers). Which don't get me wrong, it isn't a bag thing at all. This means at a budget rex price you get to enjoy full service carrier class legroom (same legroom ad Virgin Australia) and everything. There are also snacks provided during the flight (again, something you don't see often at this price point) along with a complimentary drink.

17647,17647,Rossiya Airlines,5,"""nothing outside of the ordinary""",28th February 2017,False,"  I took a trip on Aeroflot from Moscow to St. Petersburg operated by Rossiya Airlines. I booked the flight late, so I paid a considerable premium on the ticket. That said, it was cheaper than the roundtrip ticket on the Sapsan high-speed train from Moscow to Peter. As expected for a holiday weekend, the flight was at or near capacity. The A319 had more leg room than my last flight on the A319 I flew with S7 airlines, but not much more.  Boarding is not by zones, or by class it seems in Russia. It is whoever gets in line first, and a bit chaotic. The line typically forms quickly before boarding, and it is better to be early in line. Basic economy traveling is cheap within Russia, but like airlines worldwide the charges add up with luggage, etc. So everyone tries to just bring carry-on bags. Therefore, if you have carry-on luggage, you need to get in the line early or you might not find any overhead storage space. The flight is relatively short, about 1.5 hours, so you can tolerate a little discomfort. The flight attendents were professional, but not friendly. Once airborne, they hastily served a small, rather tasteless snack and choice of water, tea or coffee - no juice or alcoholic beverages. The temperature in the cabin was very warm - an experience that I have had on every flight I have taken inside of Russia. Russians tend to like it warm, but this was a bit too warm. On the return flight to Moscow, we sat in a holding pattern above Vnukovo airport for about 45 minutes and ended up reaching the gate 35 minutes late. No reason given by the pilot when he informed us of the delay, but delays sometimes happen because Vnukovo-2 is used for flights of high-ranking government officials. Overall, since I booked the tickets late it was an expensive flight, so value for the money might be skewed to the negative. However, that was my fault.

The airline enabled online check-in and this attention to detailed was mirrored elsewhere in the service provided. My one and only gripe was the abrupt woman on the check-in desk. She made no effort to even speak to me and roughly removed the protective cover to my passport and literally threw it under the counter at me. When I objected she turned her head and entered into a conversation with her uniformed colleagues. This rudeness is not acceptable and was entirely unnecessary too. the boarding process was well managed and the crew were well turned out and very professional. The interior of the 737-Max was tastefully decorated in a corporate and culturally reflective manner. Royal Air Maroc provided a nicely presented lunch box. The box itself was a work of art. It contained a small cake, sandwich and water and other items I do not recall. A route map was displayed and the cabin crew made themselves present. The lavatory was spotlessly clean. Although a relatively short flight the crew were a superb representation of their company and country. Landing and disembarkation were professionally handled and based on this experience, I would certainly use again. Royal Air Maroc put certain European airlines to shame.

Boarding was confusing as they call up families and business at once so you are in a line boarding as many families were travelling it seemed. Our seat on the plane was very spacious but we couldn’t have any bags stowed near us, all had to be put in the locker. We were offered juices/water prior to take off. Menus were distributed and the staff during this first leg were fabulous. Very friendly, they referred to us by name. The entertainment selection was very good. The food was superb, the steak ordered was very tender and the quantity of food ensured we were well and truly satisfied yet there were snacks available also. We had to go through security again to board our next flight. The flight from Bandar Seri Bagawan was on a smaller plane and it was late arriving thus late leaving. The staff were not as friendly on this section but we still got fed a sizeable main meal.

We wouldn't have bought this flight if we had known. Brunei BWN airport has nothing in it. We had an 11 hour stop over which was torture. There are no restaurants or bars in the departures lounge and the whole airport smells of urine, partly due to the revolting toilets. Onboard the flights, the evening meals were tasty. Choice of chicken or beef (chicken lasagne / stir fry ginger beef - chicken chausseur / beef biriyani). Lunch was a disgusting and sour lemon chicken wrap that repeated on you. Breakfast was disgusting chicken sausage or beef sausage with a vile baked egg style thing. Due to being an airline based in a Muslim country, this is a dry airline and all food is halal. A 2 minute long prayer is said before each take off which is quite in your face for people that don't follow Islam. Seats are reasonably comfy - ok leg room.

Outbound from Australia to Brunei there were just four passengers in Business Class, yet when I submitted my meal preference (not two hours into the flight) I was advised that it was unavailable and asked to choose something else. I accepted that reality at the time and emailed Royal Brunei Airlines after our trip to complain. No acknowledgement or response, ever - nothing. Two years later, and two issues about which I sought to engage the airline. Outbound from Brunei for Hong Kong I was unimpressed by the torn and ragged seat upholstery facing me on the back of the two seats ahead of us. I wrote to RBA about this and another matter. Again, the response was nothing. Six months later I finally manage to drag them into communication, and although the response was ‘professional-polite’, I had clearly become their serial-pest, not a customer deserving of respect. To the ‘other matter’. Upon being called to board the late evening Brunei-Melbourne flight, we followed instructions to proceed to Gate. It turns out that Gate was at the furthest end of one of their new finger piers. We walked down the totally empty pier to its farthest extremity and sat in the boarding lounge. After about 20 minutes, the staff showed up and beckoned us through the gate for a boarding check. We were then directed to walk all the way back along the totally empty finger pier to the terminal hub from whence we’d come, where we found our boarding gate was open and we could proceed onto the aircraft. I asked the airline to explain this piece of silliness. Over a series of responses I was told ‘A lot of international airports require you to walk a long distance’ (perhaps so, but not in order to return to where you started), and ‘RBA does not own the airport and has no control over the airport administration’s requirements’ (a pitiful excuse considering BWN is the primary airport in the nation of Brunei and is the home base for RBA), and finally ‘The Australian government has security requirements that caused this’. I am unhappy because it takes you half a year to drag the airline into communication, you are admonished for not having complained to the cabin crew at the time (the crew had adequate opportunity to notice the cabin furnishing damage but obviously had not),  you are lied-to regarding the reasons some particular passenger management action has occurred, you are not a satisfied customer.

Less than 24 hours before departure we got an email, you have an aircraft change to a short haul A320, with cramped uprights seats. I phoned their reservation centre who are hopeless and couldn't understand what the problem was. Ground staff and the cabin crew had no interest in the problem and besides what could they do. Look at flight data they do this regularly, sell with the promise of a flat bed on a new aircraft and then swap out an old A320 the day prior with pax having no recourse and due to the last-minute change, no ability to seek other flight options. Do not trust them. Do not waste your money. Oh, and by the way in their own business lounge, you have to pay $25 for a shower. And the food was inedible.

For this trip I decided to give RwandAir a try due of their quicker overall journey times of approx. 2.5 hours less than KA. However, the experience was very disappointing. The lie flat business class seats on the LHR-KGL leg are superb and allow a great nights sleep. The cabin staff are friendly and helpful but unfortunately that's where the good ends. On 2 of the 4 four flights involved in this return trip a Gin and Tonic could not be served due to having 'run out of tonic', on one leg the business class toilet light would not come on when the door was closed leaving it so dark I couldn't see the toilet flush button until I'd opened the door again, on another the toilet ran out of hand drying towels which were not replaced for 2 hours, there are no printed meal menus the cabin crew have the offerings hand written in an exercise book where they record each passenger's choice.

My children’s allergies were not taken seriously. They both have anaphylactic reactions to various food. I struggled to get suitable meals for them and my children were given nothing but fruit at times yet hot meals could and should have been prepared for them. I checked in Kigali if they’d have their correct meals given to them and was reassured everything had been sorted. To my surprise nothing had and staff didn’t know if allergens were in the meals they were serving. You are only asked if you want 'beef' or 'chicken' and won’t know till you open your meal if it was spicy or not. I tried to swap my child’s meal as they’d been serving beef curry with pasta and a creamy chicken dish with rice. All I’d been told was 'beef or curry' by a very rude member of staff. I asked if both my kids’ untouched and unopened meals could be swapped with chicken but the vile member of staff argued with me saying the meal which he hadn’t tasted himself, wasn’t spicy! What could have been resolved in seconds took longer than necessary. He challenged me in an aggressive tone, which was completely unnecessary. He reluctantly agreed to swap the meals over. He’d told me there were no other meals for my children so I based my choice on guess work. Had I known in advance that my children’s dietary requirements wouldn’t be met on such a long flight, I’d have spent my money elsewhere. Other than that there were several stops and delays on our way to Zimbabwe. Seats were double booked from Kigali to Lusaka. On our return we struggled to find seats with our children and staff announced that passengers should sit wherever there was a seat. Staff made sure toilets were clean but they could have at least changed gloves as they wore the same gloves they’d been wearing while serving food. The plus side is: one of their meals was delicious, their flights are generally more affordable than most but that comes with a price. Rwandair has more luggage allowance than most in relation to Zimbabwe, staff on our way to Zimbabwe were friendly and approachable aside from speaking in their own language, they also kept passengers well hydrated considering the heat. It would be helpful for staff to carry a laminate list of ingredients as none of them seem to know what’s in the food they serve and it would be helpful to actually say to passengers “Would you like beef curry served with pasta or would you like creamy chicken and rice” rather than “beef or rice”. Some customers who don’t eat spicy food can make a choice rather than having to guess and waste food by returning or swapping it. To and from, staff didn’t know what sort of meals they were serving.

Boarding was late on both flights, starting at the time the gate was supposed to close according to the ticket schedule. As with other Russian airlines, there is no pre-boarding or boarding by zones. Once the gate opens, it is a rush to board. It is important to board early on a budget airline like S7, because with bag charges, everyone tries to carry on as much as possible, and the overhead compartments fill quickly. Despite the chaotic boarding, both flights departed close to schedule. On both flights the cabin temperature was uncomfortably warm for me, but if you live in Russia, you know that Russians like it warm - very warm.

Thereafter their San Jose ground staff debated for an hour that they had fulfilled the conditions of carriage (LOL) and staunchly refused to compensate with a hotel room or replacement flight for marooning us in San Jose (and losing my regional booking), and then when they finally conceded, they put myself and another passenger who I had just met in the same hotel room. Of course I fought this nonsense, too. Hard to imagine a meaner or more immature form of conduct. In another case, trying to get a flight back to San Jose after my trip in Nosara a few weeks later, they cancelled a flight with under 10 minutes notice, and thus myself and a handful of others lost follow-on bookings, including two unfortunate French teenagers who lost their $2000+ flights back to Europe.

I accepted hesitantly as I always pack my small carry on for 3 days. My meds, supplements, some personal hygiene, an extra set of clothes. Cleared security. Got to the gate, 1 hour later we were advised the flight is delayed. Fair enough. A second announcement was for a boarding gate change. From b41, to b40. Another hour, flight is delayed. A 4 announcement another boarding gate change to b38. Was mention it was the requested by the airport . 2.5 hours later boarding begins. Ufff happy of course to get on the plane. Departure is 2.5 hours late. Probably one of the most uncomfortable flights I’ve taken in a long time. We arrive in Ponta Delgada. Late, I missed my connection. I had to take my 3 bags, 2 x 23 kg, plus my carry on. The carousel stops. No bags. There are 20 people waiting for bags, parents with kids several with connections like me.

18430,18430,Saudi Arabian Airlines,1,“far from what was promised”,30th January 2025,True,"  I recently flew from Dhaka to London with Saudia and upgraded to business class for the Dhaka to Jeddah leg of my journey. Unfortunately, the experience was far from what was promised and turned out to be one of the worst airline experiences I’ve had. Saudia Airlines advertises a dedicated check-in counter for business class passengers, yet at Dhaka airport, the business class counter was  unmanned. Meanwhile, economy passengers were being checked in smoothly. I had to wait 20 minutes, speak to multiple staff members, and go through unnecessary hassle just to complete my check-in. At the boarding gate, there was no separate queue or fast-track service for business class passengers. Everyone was forced into the same long line, waiting over an hour just to board the flight. After passing all the required airport security checks, I was shocked to find Saudia’s own staff conducting additional baggage and body searches at the airplane gate. I was forced to open my carry-on luggage in front of strangers. The flight crew were shockingly unprofessional and rude, they struggled with basic English. The in-flight entertainment system did not work throughout the journey. I paid a significant amount to upgrade to business class, yet I received none of the premium benefits promised. From the chaotic check-in to the lack of priority boarding, unnecessary security checks, and unprofessional service, this was one of the worst flights I have taken.

Saudi Airlines has some redeeming features. Lets get the main issue out of the way and then be positive. The two women at the check in desk at Frankfurt were truly appalling beyond belief. First I was told my case was 1kg over the limit, and I had to adjust it and rejoin the queue. I went to another airline to check again with their weight of my case only to find it 0.kg under, keeping me to assume the original weighing was corrupt. Then I was challenged get about my length of stay in Bangkok, and she would not issue a ticket for me until I booked an onward flight, so I quickly booked on on trip.com costing £62 for something I won't use. Explaining that I am sailing from Thailand and returning sone months later cut no ice with this officious lady. Still she was not satisfied and I joined the queue for the third time, which become the fourth when the queue I was in 3rd place suddenly stopped and and I was told to join the one remaining queue demoting me to 30th place. Eventually I got the ticket but was stopped by her equally obstructive colleague at the boarding area. It seems the original lady messed up the onward flight number. Terrible, terrible service that shot my stress level through the roof. So, onto the journey to Riyadh. Plane very clean, staff attentive, never tried the food as I felt unwell from the earlier experiences. Disembarking quick and efficient via bus to the main airport which was very new and clean. Onward flight to Bangkok was pleasant, but still didn't eat, staff very helpful and polite. A request for an extra drink dealt with immediately. In flight entertainment somewhat limited for a westerner, but Internet was available for a fee. Seats on second leg were very comfortable leather (I think) seats. Nice. What a shame those awful women at Frankfurt probly swayed me to not using this airline again. I've given a fair 5 out of 10 for the food after asking a German passenger for his views.

18472,18472,Saudi Arabian Airlines,5,"""lacking that warmth and personal touch""",1st January 2024,True,"  Bangkok to Al Ula via Jeddah, and back. On the positive side, I found that Saudia flights were Likely to be less full than their Middle Eastern counterparts, even during peak Xmas season - on the B787, almost every passenger had the middle seat free, and some even had the entire row to themselves. On the A321, everybody had a row to themselves. I also liked the reasonable pricing during this peak holiday season, somehow perhaps I get the feeling that being a profitable airline isn’t exactly a top priority? Little details like Email notifications on gate assignments & when boarding commences helped too. It may seem so insignificant yet it is actually so useful. One last thing that is so easy to overlook, is that despite the mediocre service to be elaborated upon below, they seem to have a decent on-time performance, one of the best in the world. On the negative side, I found to be really annoying the double security checks on inbound flights, frisked and patted down violently for all passengers, regardless of travel class (Business or Economy). I’m sure no other passenger liked that either. The second security check took place at the aerobridge, just before boarding the aircraft. I found other aspects of the Saudia experience to be simply mediocre or neutral. Starting with the legroom (seat pitch), Interestingly enough their older A321CEOs had the most generous amounts of legroom. The newer B787-9s seemed to scale back on the legroom, which in my opinion was sufficient but not generous. It was around the same as most other Skytrax 4-star airlines like Oman Air & Etihad, which for short or mid-haul flights are still acceptable, but would hurt for longer-haul flights. Also average were the IFE and Meal Service. I put them together because they were all satisfactory and sufficient but not luxurious or generous. Last of all, the Cabin Crew attitude was alright, but not great. They’re certainly still lacking that warmth and personal touch which put most Asian Airlines a cut above the rest.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/F00F977C-72CD-4313-AD66-52D9F7F88449-500x500.jpeg,Boeing 787-9 / A321CEO,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Al Ula via Jeddah,December 2023,3.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,3.0,,4.0,no,positive,0.5189585089683533,5.8159685134887695,airliner

Lounge was okay, nothing too excited. The on board chef introduced himself and came round with arabic coffee and dates, which i found to be a nice way to start the flight,. The seats were private and i slept well throughout. 1st leg crew was very attentive and smiling, dine on demand did not have my choice of desert. 2nd leg - crew was a bit reserved, i was still full from the previous flight, asked if i could just have the arabic mezze and fruit, she seemed shocked & surprised, later asked for a tea, she did not seem friendly but robotic. 3rd leg crew was pleasant, nothing to comment about. 4th leg -crew was pleasant, ordered pancakes for breakfast with fruit yoghurt, asked if i could have a bowl of fresh fruit as well, but she said i can only have one or the other, strange considering it was dine on demand and you could have what ever you want and at anytime you want. I found the entertainment system to be minimal, not offering much for the western traveller on film choices, the rest rooms were not up to standard and maintained, it was wet and paper was on the floor at times. I would describe the lounge as being quite basic considering it is a new airport, staff were okay & pleasant enough, nothing to write home about. The shower facility was good especially with rainfall showers.

18521,18521,Saudi Arabian Airlines,2,Saudi Arabian Airlines customer review,1st February 2023,True,"  I am writing to you to express my great dissatisfaction with my recent experience with Saudi Airlines. January 3rd flew Saudia from Washington DC to Lahore via Jeddah and encountered terrible service. I lost my Hand-carry which they took away at time of getting into the plane. The service I received from the airline staff was unprofessional, rude, and slow. My flight was delayed for 19 hours at Jeddah airport, and when I asked the staff for an explanation, they were unable to provide one. I found the staff attitude towards customers to be unhelpful and dismissive. Worse yet, when my flight finally arrived, my hand-carry was nowhere to be found. I had to purchase new clothes, toiletries, and other items in order to make it through the rest of my trip. I had to pay for these items out of my own pocket. I was also disappointed in the customer service I received when I reported the lost baggage. The staff was unhelpful and unsympathetic, and it was clear that they did not take my complaint seriously. They refused to give me a claim number by saying that it was not needed. I have tried to contact the airline both by phone and email, but I have not yet been able to speak to any customer service representatives who can provide me with information regarding my hand-carry. They hung-up the phone on me when I asked for some help. I have now been without my luggage for over three weeks and have yet to receive any response from the airline.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6A1270D7-FDDA-4757-A397-A56EB6692D9F-500x500.jpeg,Boeing 777,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Washington  to Lahore via Jeddah,January 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,negative,0.9084101319313048,6.702190399169922,airliner

18526,18526,Saudi Arabian Airlines,7,"""great full service airline"" ",7th January 2023,True,"  I spent a span of 21 hours flying Saudia across three regions of the world in economy and satisfied with my experience in the whole. To start, the pros to flying Saudia was the price, seating and it's incredible staff. My flight was extremely affordable relative to competitors and the seats were fantastic due to having a lot of empty seats around. Additionally, inflight crew were  friendly and took initiative in the most authentic way. I felt well looked after in the most genuine way! As for my cons, they dealt with the lack of cleanliness, catering and online infrastructure. My seat from Geneva and to a lesser extent out of Jeddah to Seoul wasn't the cleanest. One of my flights had residual trash in the seat pocket and a lot of dirt was wiped off using a wet towel. Moreover, I get that economy food doesn't have a reputation for being 5-star, but the pasta I had was rubbery, tasteless and inept at hiding the fact that it was mass produced. Finally, Saudia could invest a little in improving their online/app features for requesting special meals as they were difficult to navigate and calling was too much trouble due to prolonged wait times. In summary, Saudia is a great full service airline to fly for those who value comfort and service for a price that doesn't break the bank!",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/processed-0e7d13c8-1f29-40b8-b993-4b69ac52bf1b_ODbdd5Qc-500x500.jpeg,A330 / Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Geneva to Seoul via Jeddah ,January 2023,3.0,5.0,2.0,3.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,yes,positive,0.9441348314285278,5.653824806213379,paper towel

18623,18623,Scoot,3,"""an absolute no-frills airline""",28th April 2023,False," This review refers to the flight with Scoot from Berlin to Bali (via Singapore) and the corresponding return flight a few weeks later. The points apply to all legs of the journey, although the long haul Berlin-Singapore and back is clearly more significant and determines the rating. Scoot advertises itself as the small subsidiary of Singapore Airlines (""The little sister of Singapore Airlines""). This is certainly correct in terms of content, but it is absolutely misleading. The service Scoot offers has nothing to do with the fantastic Singapore Airlines! Absolute nothing! Scoot is an absolute no-frills airline in its purest form, even worse than Ryanair. The passenger has to pay for everything. It starts when booking with the food on board, continues with extra luggage and seat reservations. If you don't pay for your seat, a seat will be allocated to you during check-in without any choice for you. And, on board, the customers' money continues to be taken out of their pockets. If you want to drink water on board, which real airlines serve free of charge and in abundance to their passengers for health reasons, you have to pay for it at Scoot. There is no entertainment programme on board, not even monitors to track the flight route. If you use your mobile phone, tablet, etc., you will definitely run out of power during a 12-13 hour flight. There are power sockets, but if you want electricity for charging, you have to pay for it. Regarding the service on board: The staff was always friendly and nice. Thank you for that. But, the food is pretty much the most unappealing and uncharitable food I have seen in my life. And it doesn't even taste good. You are given simple, welded food containers and a can of water. If you know real quality airlines, what Scoot delivers is a huge disappointment. On the return flight SIN-BER, the folding tables (several in my row) were so dirty. I guess they have not been cleaned for a long time. Thank god I had disinfectant and a cloth with me. Yikes, Scoot! In summary, it must be said that the customer at Scoot is apparently only there to flush money into the company. There is no question of appreciation of the flight guests. These flights fall into the category: There is no second chance for a first impression. We flew exactly twice with Scoot, the first and the last time. I would rather spend a little more money on a real, good airline than fly long-haul with Scoot again. For short-haul (up to about 3 hours, it's ok).",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chicken-Ragout-500x500.jpg,Boeing 787,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Berlin to Bali via Singapore,March 2023,3.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,,2.0,no,neutral,0.611615777015686,5.545340538024902,burrito

After spending a lot of money, I found out the connection wasn’t missed after all! When I tried to get a refund, the airline refused to take responsibility. The customer service at the airport was a joke—the staff barely spoke English and seemed to mock my situation. I’ve never flown with them, and after this experience, I never will.

Plus limited recline, circa 30 degrees from vertical, upon which when the person in the seat in front of you is reclined you have even less space to maneuver in and out and are pretty much forced to recline yourself to retain a semblance of spacing. Added to which the seat controls for recline, footrest, lumber massage are really stiff mechanical levers. For a brand new plane absolutely abysmal! There is  no in flight entertainment in the seat backs. In business one is issued with an iPad which can stream movies etc. through the Silk Air WiFi. This does not support Internet connectivity, only the IFE. If you want to use your own device you need to have previously installed the Silk Air app from the app store - something nobody tells you before you board. In the cramped seat space there is very little place to put the iPad, even on the little plastic prop available on request, so one ends up holding it whilst also trying to juggle a meal or whatever. No noise cancelling headphones, just cheap in-ear buds, so I plugged my own noise cancellers in to the iPad. No capability to connect via Bluetooth of course.

First and foremost, upon booking on Travelocity, you are tricked in to thinking you are booking with a trusted major airline (United) to find out this is some unknown start up airline and flies old propeller planes with fresh paint. Our flight was delayed 3 hours for repairs than finally boarded just to sit for another 30 minutes before we were deboarded due to repairs being incomplete. Then ultimately, canceled the entire flight and said you would get refunds in 7-10 days. Stranded with no care of how you will get to your destination. Horrible, horrible airline. Shame on United for allowing this fly by night airline to be associated with United and ruining their reputation as a trusted airline.

At the Gate they told me this is your gate but we are delayed. I said why is there no indication nowhere about the Gate, the delay and so on. Then only the lady made an announcement. I asked why the wrong gate is still displayed. They have no control over the boards. I asked can't you call whoever is in control of the departure and gate displays? No answer.

Food and drinks were super despite ‘Book the Cook’ wasn’t available on this flight to SIN. We had a connecting flight from SIN where ‘Book the Cook’ was available but where previously lobster always used to be one of the options to select it now no longer is available. This is really a pity as this was one of our favourites on SQ flights. Perhaps they introduced this as a cost saving but I do not understand why they should do a cost saving while the cost of the already expensive tickets increased almost 50%. Recent flights we took on SQ were also somewhat inconsistent and what makes or breaks a good flight for us is a good crew.

Their blasé attitude and flippant responses serve as a slap in the face to passengers who entrust them with their belongings. What's particularly galling is the stark dissonance between the information disseminated at the departure airport and the subsequent communication from their service team.

But nothing was done and people proceeded to get their HUGE bags from the cargo bins. When we finally got off, we ran through two terminals and our plane was loading.

19864,19864,Spirit Airlines,1,"""unprofessional behavior and poor service"" ",25th February 2025,True,"   I have never encountered such unprofessional behavior and poor service from an airline. First, the flight attendants were incredibly rude, the aircraft was dirty, and the cabin was uncomfortably hot. Before the flight even took off, a child near us was feeling unwell. One flight attendant briefly asked what was wrong, and when the boy said he was sick, she simply walked away, despite clearly seeing that he was in distress. Unfortunately, the child ended up vomiting on his seat and onto surrounding passengers. Instead of providing immediate assistance, the crew ignored the situation until much later, only cleaning up at the very end and then asking him to move seats. Additionally, my children experienced unacceptable mistreatment regarding their carry-on luggage. As they boarded, they attempted to place their bags in the overhead bins, as we have always done on previous flights. However, a flight attendant aggressively scolded them, insisting they put their bags under the seat, even though there was clearly no space for them. We had standard-sized carry-on luggage meant for the overhead bin. My children speak English but not fluently, so they were initially confused by the sudden rule change, especially since other passengers were freely placing their bags and jackets in the overhead compartments without issue. The flight attendant told them they could only store their bags overhead after everyone was seated. My children complied, even though they were confused as to why they were being singled out. When the time came and my children began placing their bags overhead, the same flight attendant suddenly rushed back and started threatening to remove them from the flight for “not following instructions”—even though they were simply doing what they had been told. She spoke to them in an extremely aggressive tone, raising her voice and refusing to let them explain. When they asked why other passengers were allowed to store their bags while they were not, she rudely cut them off and told them to “stop talking and listen.” Eventually, another flight attendant did give them permission to place their bags in the overhead bin. However, when they began to do so, yet another crew member came over and started yelling at them again. This was humiliating, stressful, and completely unnecessary. It wasn’t until the first attendant intervened and told her colleague that she had allowed it that they finally left my children alone. But there was no apology.  This level of unprofessionalism and hostility is completely unacceptable.

So instead of the flight being 4pm it changed to 8:30pm and I would arrive at 11pm. I sat in the airport from 2pm waiting for my flight with my family until 8:30pm which was when boarding started. However, my connecting flight did not delay to match my first flight so the second flight departed at 10:30pm. I stayed on the phone with Spirit Airlines customer service for more than an hour trying to figure out a solution to this problem. They told me all the flights were booked and were not able to provide a hotel for me and my family to stay at because it was a weather issue not maintenance which I understand but they did not help at all. They kept changing the gate number and there were no announcements which made not just me but a lot of other passengers confused. After we got to Florida, I received my newly purchased bags in terrible condition which I attached pictures of. I went to the customer service there and I told them everything and she said that they can’t do anything because of the weather and the closest flight available was Monday which was the 17th. When I asked her how much the refund would be if I cancelled it, she told me “give me a second” and I waited. I thought she was looking for another solution but then she said she cancelled it, which is not what I asked for. When I told her that, she was arguing with me and being very rude and said that I was the one who told her to cancel the flight. We asked her to get a manager to reverse the cancellation, the manager didn’t even show up. She did not care to fix our problem and that was a huge issue because some of us had work the next day that couldn’t be missed.

Check in at Heathrow was quick and efficient, Business Class passengers get to use the BA Galleries lounge at T3, this was not busy and there was plenty of seats available. The food didn’t look that special, so didn’t bother. Flight boarded on time and departed only a few minutes behind schedule. Business Class on the A330-300 was fairly standard 1-2-1 configuration, my wife and I had selected the middle two (seats 4D and 4G) in the middle of 7 rows inthe cabin. The plane was not that new, but the cabin was clean, comfortable and the seat/bed controls all worked fine. The cabin crew were very professional and friendly, so no complaints there. Dinner was served shortly after take-off, my wife chose the fillet steak which she said was very nice, I chose the Chicken Kalupol Curry, which was very tasty. Sri Lankan serve Joseph Perrier Champagne, which was pleasant. One aspect of the flight, which was disappointing was the IFE, the choice of films was very poor. They had a large number of Christmas films showing, I get this in December, but not in February! Passing on the films, we both managed to get some sleep, before breakfast was served a couple of hours before landing. Breakfast was a bit disappointing, but this is the case with most airlines! Flight landed on schedule into Colombo BIA and we were through immigration and out of the airport with luggage in 30 minutes.

20022,20022,SriLankan Airlines,1,"""turned out to be anything but pleasant""",3rd August 2023,True,"  I recently had the misfortune of traveling with SriLankan Airlines on flight UL217 from Colombo to Doha. Unfortunately, my journey turned out to be anything but pleasant, and I feel compelled to share my experience to warn other travelers. The entertainment system was completely non-functional. The touch display did not respond to any inputs, leaving me and many other passengers without any form of in-flight entertainment for the duration of the flight. When I alerted a male cabin crew member about the issue, he seemed dismissive and offered a quick fix that didn't work. This lack of concern for the passengers' comfort and entertainment was truly disappointing. Seeking a solution, I approached a female cabin crew member with the same problem. Much to my dismay, she was equally unhelpful, claiming that nothing could be done due to the flight being fully booked. While I understand that changing seats might not have been possible, it was concerning to realize that such a basic issue had not been addressed before the flight's departure. The situation worsened when I discovered that my seat's table was broken and hanging without proper support. This made it nearly impossible for me to enjoy the in-flight meals without risking spills and accidents. During meal service, the cabin crew's attempt to serve me food while trying to balance the tray with one hand was downright unsafe, especially during periods of turbulence. Despite my repeated requests to inform the cabin manager, no one attended to the matter, leaving me feeling disregarded and frustrated. Upon landing in Doha, I hoped to address these issues through the airline's customer service team. I promptly sent an email detailing my ordeal and expressing my dissatisfaction, but I received no response or acknowledgment for several days. The lack of any meaningful communication from the airline added to my disappointment. In conclusion, my flight experience with SriLankan Airlines on UL217 was far from satisfactory. The non-functional entertainment system and broken seat table significantly impacted my comfort and safety throughout the journey. The dismissive attitude of the cabin crew, coupled with the lack of any response to my complaint, only deepened my disappointment. As a paying passenger, I expected a certain level of service and comfort, which was clearly lacking on this flight. I hope this review serves as a warning to others considering traveling with SriLankan Airlines. I would advise potential passengers to weigh their options carefully and choose an airline that prioritizes customer satisfaction and promptly addresses passenger concerns.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/WhatsApp-Image-2023-08-03-at-9.32.02-PM-500x500.jpeg,A330-300,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Colombo to D0ha,July 2023,1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,1.0,no,negative,0.8646579384803772,5.053630828857422,modem
20029,20029,SriLankan Airlines,8,"""deserves an admirable reputation""",30th June 2023,True,"  A few years ago, I had flown Sri Lankan's A330, which had a 2x2x2 Business Class cabin. And was now looking forward to the newer 1x2x1 reverse-herringbone configuration on the flight from Colombo to London. At Colombo airport, the check-in lane for business class passengers was drab looking with a well-worn red carpet. However, I was greeted with a smile and was given an invitation to their Serendib Lounge. The boarding was efficiently handled, and the 28-seat cabin was full. Welcomed with the traditional 'Ayubowan' greeting, I was pointed in the direction of my window seat. The seat itself looked attractive, in deep green-blue colours and shades of beige elsewhere. All the essential functions were within easy reach. The armrest could be lowered or raised and the IFE monitor had to be opened out for viewing. A large pillow and blanket were placed on the seat. The usual noise-cancelling headphones and Aigner amenity kit, slippers and socks were also placed in the seat compartments. The foldout table was sturdy, although it was not possible to move it towards you for a more comfortable position when dining. This was an all-daylight flight and no sooner had I settled down, than cold towels were handed out and pre-departure drinks were served, and I was wished an enjoyable flight. The printed menu had a choice of three main courses and a wide selection of drinks. I was a little disappointed that the whole meal was served on the single tray, and not the starter first, followed by the main course, to make it more of a 'dining experience'. However, both lunch and dinner meals were tasty, finishing off with coffee and liqueurs. A couple of hours or so after lunch, the window blinds were pulled down for a rest period, with mood lighting. Stretching my seat to a flat bed position, I was able to get a couple of hours sleep. The cabin crew passed by on several occasions, checking on passengers if they needed anything else. When I requested a coffee and cognac, it was served along with a full coffee pot, which was a nice touch. A most enjoyable aspect of my flight was the cabin crew, their attentive and friendly service and engaging in short bursts of conversation with passengers - some even posing with me for photos. The hard product may not be as luxurious as some other airlines, but on the service front, in my view, Sri Lankan Airlines deserves an admirable reputation.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Sri-Lankan-Airlines-Business-Class-dining-lunch-Seer-Fich-main-course-June-2023-500x416.jpg,A330,Business,Business Class,Colombo to London,June 2023,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,,3.0,yes,positive,0.6951625347137451,7.944984436035156,plate

However, it began with easy check-in and boarding was smoothly handled inviting several rows at a time. The cabin layout is the standard 2x4x2 with a 32-inch pitch. The seat itself was comfortable, with a slight recline. The legroom was sufficient too, as I am not tall. And the footrest was certainly welcome. A small pillow and blanket were also provided, along with headphones. The IFE was fairly extensive with both classic and blockbuster movies, online magazines and games. Being a redeye flight, the service began almost immediately after the seatbelt sign was turned off. No hot towels, as it used to be years ago. Pre-dinner drinks were on offer, and when I asked for a whiskey on ice, I was served with two doubles! It was nice to see proper metal cutlery back again in economy. The main course of rice with chicken curry and aubergines was delicious, but all portions were sadly quite small, and squeezed into the tiny tray, just like those on European business class flights. After dinner, I requested coffee and cognac which was served promptly. Once the dinner service was over, the cabin lights were dimmed and mood lighting came on which meant bed time. I think I got about two hours of sleep. Breakfast was the standard Western menu which was pretty awful. However, the overall service was very good, and the cabin crew was very friendly and obliging, and engaging in small talk with passengers.

The quality of the food is atrocious, flying business class you expect better quality and for your options to be available, given this is most likely the smallest availability of business class seats available on a flight I have seen for such a long journey. The business class had 7 seats vacant so it’s not like they were at full capacity. Both dinner and breakfast meals were limited in their choice, with breakfast apparently only having 5 breakfast omelettes available for the whole of business class. The quality of the food is no different to that of economy.

It got pushed back to midnight, leaving us stranded at a closed Denpasar Airport with no food or drink options. Adding insult to injury, they moved the gate last minute just to mess with us more. Did they apologize? Offer compensation? Nope. The ground staff were okay, but they could only do so much with an airline that clearly doesn't give a damn about its passengers. There were no rescheduling options, and refunds are supposed to take 90 days. When we finally got on the plane, it was like stepping into a time machine—straight to an aircraft museum. The seats were just okay, but there was no in-flight entertainment. Snacks were there, but they didn't make up for the overall misery. We landed at 01:30AM Jakarta time in a remote parking spot. Then, in drizzling rain, we had to deplane using stairs without umbrellas and walk to the arrival terminal. I'd recommend to avoid NAM and Sriwijaya Air like the plague.

20124,20124,STARLUX Airlines,8,"""very professional and courteous"" ",11th January 2025,True,"   After much fanfare and glowing reviews surrounding this relatively new transpacific airline operating out of Taipei, I decided that I had to give it a try to see if it lived up to its hype. The booking experience was straightforward and smooth, when online check in opened I managed to select a seat at no extra cost, and successfully managed to download the mobile boarding pass into my digital wallet. So we were off to a good start. The A330neo is a great choice for regional and short to mid-haul flights, its 2-4-2 configuration in economy making the cabin intimate and cosy with fewer passengers stuck in window seats. Another good start was when boarding proceeded smoothly and we took off on time. Legroom was comfortable without being too generous, with Google putting it at 79cm, the long-haul industry average but nothing spectacular. The cabin appeared to be spanking clean and in tip-top condition, with its comforting shade of brown appeasing to the eyes. Both USB-A and USB-C charging ports were offered, and the seat even included a pillow for this short hop cross the Taiwan Strait. Unfortunately, dining options seemed to have fallen short, with the food rather bland and not as appetising. A small packet of juice was offered, but no choices were given and neither was plain drinking water. Another pet peeve is that in this day and age, somehow Starlux does not have their IFE system connected to their PA system, hence the IFE system was not allowed to be used during takeoff and landing. It’s the first time I’ve experienced something like this on an aircraft that has an IFE system, which by the way was pretty comprehensive. The crew were all very professional and courteous, and consistently checked on passengers during the short flight. As a bonus, we landed 12 minutes ahead of schedule, thanks to the speedy boarding and takeoff process. All in all still a very attractive option in this competitive market, though it falls short in an few areas and certainly has room for improvement.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_4839-500x500.jpeg,A330-900NEO,Business,Economy Class,Taipei  to Hong Kong ,January 2025,5.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,,5.0,yes,positive,0.9132403135299684,6.308335304260254,airliner
20138,20138,Sun Country Airlines,1,"""flawed customer service"" ",10th February 2025,False,"  Unprofessional business practices, flawed customer service, failure to provide services as advertised, complete refusal to provide refunds. I was booked a flight PHX -> MSP -> MCO by my employer. The flight to MSP was delayed over an hour due to a ""controllable error"" on behalf of Sun Country which caused me to miss my connecting flight to MCO. There was another Sun Country flight to MCO from the same terminal. I was denied access to this flight because the attendant ""wasn't allowed to rebook at the gate."" The flight took off with empty seats in it and me stuck in MSP. I was told my checked bag was at MCO by Sun Country representatives. I would later come to find this was a lie. I was offered a rebook that would have me landing at MCO 14 hours after the original flight's landing; this was not an option as I had my brother's wedding to attend as his best man. I was refused all options to be rebooked on a different airline despite the fact that I was inconvenienced by Sun Country on a mistake that was solely their fault. I accepted a voucher for the cost of the flight and figured my employer could keep the voucher and pay me the cost of a rebook with Frontier. I rebooked with Frontier and then was informed, moments before boarding my new flight, that my bag was in MSP. Apparently, without my consent, the bag was refunded as well and left sitting in MSP without my knowledge - I only learned because I was called by a Sun Country representative while at the gate to depart with Frontier. Sun Country refused to send my bag to Orlando using the voucher.

I was then told to go back to Lombok Airport and complain to the Airport staff, so I did. I was directed to the Super Air Jet office, where their staff essentially dismissed my claim and lied to my face. It’s a gross failure of the airline that no internal reports have been raised for the extensive damage caused to my bag. The airport was insistent that was entitled to receive a Property Irregularity Report form which I would need to claim on my insurance. They refused to hand it over and placed security either side of me to try and intimidate me. The manager even left the room to let less senior members of staff deal with me and the airport staff.

Today is 3rd December, no one has call me or reply my question about compensation.

They pushed the responsibility to me to contact lost and found Incheon airport instead of them assisting me to find my luggage, it was their staff who didn’t tag it during my check in. Lesson learnt! Never travel with them again! At our own risk if baggage is lost and compensation is zero and not as printed in the fine line! Really horrible ground handling, no support at all. When I have clearly told them via app counselling form that Lost and found Incheon isn’t responding to my emails, Tway continued to tell me contact them! Terrible experience.

20567,20567,TAAG Angola Airlines,1,"""passenger cabin has so many defects""",30th October 2024,False,"  I was flying to Luanda by TAAG Angola Airlines. When I was going to the gate, I saw the plane which looked like an elderly but friendly Boeing 777-300. I had never flew by Anogla Airlines before, therefore I was full of hope and enthusiasm for a pleasant and relaxing journey. But soon after boarding the plane, the magic of the trip was gone and a mixture of amazement and concern started to raise in my head and the same expression was evident on the faces of passengers around me. Plane inside looked well worn, but I still hoped to watch a movie and rest a bit before arriving in Luanda. Sadly entertainment panels were not working and were damaged, so I thought to myself - not a big deal, I will watch something on my phone, but when I tried to plug cable to USB port to charge it a little, USB port was not working either. I wanted to change my seat to look for a working panel, but it turned out that none of them are working and many of the USB charging ports were simply missing in many seats and there was just a hole in the seats. I tried to stay positive, well I have a book to read so I can read for a while instead, right? Unfortunately the seat lights were not working either and the whole cabin was dark.  I tried to deploy the foot rest, but to my surprise, both foot rest pedals were missing too.  Since the passenger cabin has so many defects, it surely must have failed some periodic checks, or maybe they were never carried out? I learned later is that TAAG Angola Airline was blacklisted - banned from EU airspace for many years for failing to meet regulatory oversight standards and restrictions were lifted only before covid. It seems to me that decision was premature and perhaps needs to be re-evaluated as clearly this airline is not carrying out basic checks! On the positive note, the cabin crew gave an excellent safety demonstration on the use of life jacket.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/photo1-500x500.jpg,Boeing 777-300,Business,Economy Class,Sao Paulo to Luanda,September 2024,1.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,positive,0.5950348973274231,6.878004550933838,airliner

20600,20600,TAAG Angola Airlines,7,"""Service was friendly""",21st May 2022,False,"  We flew with TAAG from  Cape Town. As of a few days ago, passengers in transit no longer need to do the mandatory rapid covid test at airport in Luanda.  Cape Town to Luanda is 3.5 hours in an older 737-700. Food was ok, not bad. Service was friendly even with a full flight. No inflight entertainment system. Arriving in Luanda we had to take the rapid test in a hanger. The process takes around 30-60 minutes depending how full flights are. For our return flight (2 weeks later) they thankfully stopped this mandatory testing. You just need to show your negative RT-PCR test (not older than 72 hours of flight). It does not matter if you’re vaccinated or not, the PCR test is all they want to see. Rapid covid tests are not permitted for leaving SA or Portugal. Ground staff are well informed. The wait at Luanda airport was long around 5 hours before boarding the next flight close to midnight. We flew TAAG 5 years ago so coming back to Luanda we had an idea what to expect. In short it’s a chaotic basic airport with little to offer except expensive drinks and food. There are even strange flea market type stalls selling traditional African items. Admittedly the airport has been upgraded a bit, now offering a duty free store and more open seating. This time we stayed in the Pall lounge using our Lounge Key Visa benefit. The lounge is basic but comfortable. They give you a few vouchers to exchange for drinks or toasted sandwiches. At least it is airconditioned. The flight to Lisbon was on a modern 777-300ER with a 3-3-3 seating with some of the best leg room I’ve experienced. At 1.86m tall, I still had plenty room in front of my knees. At present their inflight entertainment system has been turned off. This did not bother us, as at midnight you don’t really want to watch movies…the flight is only 7 hours to Lisbon so sleep comes in handy for a full day ahead. Shortly after take off, they bring you dinner. We had a choice of beef or bacalhau (fish) which was actually quite tasty. The toilets were clean on all flights. Breakfast was also served around 90 minutes before landing in Lisbon. Coming back to Cape Town was only a 2.5 hours transit at Luanda so quite convenient. To go back to SA you don’t need a PCR test if you are vaccinated. If not vaccinated then you have to do the test which is quite expensive around 80euros. All 4 flights there and back were perfectly on time, some even landed earlier than stated. Luggage allowance. Most tickets now cover you for 2 x 23kg bags in economy. Masks have to be worn on all flights except when eating but not heavily enforced. TAAG does not come close to Middle East airlines in terms of inflight entertainment, but the short overall flying time combined with a lower airfare works well for us, especially compared to options on other airlines which take much longer and cost a lot more.

20886,20886,TAP Portugal,1,"""worst airline I have ever flown""",25th February 2024,True,"  Quite definitely the worst airline I have ever flown. Forget delays, long bus boarding, chaotic hoarding procedures etc. Many airlines have just as bad reputations as TAP. What disgusts me most is the onboard experience. TAP provides one of the most restrictive legroom and seat space in the world. At a mere 28cm, you simply can't have your kegs straight in the seat. How they get away with this is astonishing. It can seriously hurt your legs and blood flow (I'm 1,83cm so not that tall). Due to Lisbon's location, most of their European flight still be over two hours. And it's two hours of hell. I swore when I flew to Cape Verde with them about five years ago that I would never fly again with them but had no choice for this flight. I came to regret it the minute I entered the cabin again. The staff onboard is ok but the food offerings they sell are extremely limited and very unappetising. I didn't see many people purchase anything. But it's all really about the lack of comfort in your seat. That's what it's all about. And the flights were nearly 500 euro return so astonishingly bad value for what you pay. Even low cost carriers have more leg room.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/PXL_20240210_221022265-500x500.jpg,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Amsterdam to Lisbon,February 2024,1.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,negative,0.921625316143036,4.3244147300720215,oxygen mask

Then when you file a complaint they don’t have call center so no one can take your call. All they say is that it can take months for someone to handle your case. I will never fly with them again.

We were contacted at least thrice for seat changes to end up with this aircraft. The aircraft has 1-1-1 seat configuration (seats A, G, K). The seat seems narrow (29”?), storage space is limited, fully reclined bed is possible but you’d need to rise up to use this feature. Although the A seat is a window seat but your feet always point to the aisle and some seats may not be able to see out of the window. The G & K seats are worse since both have feet pointed to the opposite and face each other. Thus no privacy is assured as hypothesised. The IFE has no map features, only elapsed times are available (aircrew couldn’t get the map features for me). Honestly, we notice that service quality varies depending upon who you’re (ROP/Star Alliance status, ages, familiarity with crew, etc.). This flight was over booked and some were offered to downgrade to P/E with USD 200 compensation, experiencing what just described we regret that we didn’t take that offer!

21058,21058,Thai Airways,5,“deterioration of standards”,14th October 2024,True," SIN to HKG via BKK, first on an A350 followed by a B777. Thai Airways International is an airline that I have been flying for the past 25 years and is therefore close to heart, and unfortunately it's deterioration of standards have got to the point that it is glaring and apparent. Even before stepping onboard the aircraft, I tried to do online check-in, but when I tried to download the mobile boarding pass it only showed me an error page multiple times so I had to get the physical boarding pass at the counter. My flight on 9 Oct TG408 according to flightradar24, (only departed at 1953 and arrived at 2052hrs), despite being scheduled for an 1815 departure. The aircraft, HS-THR, prior to the flight to Singapore, did a rotation to Seoul Incheon (TG 656 & TG657), and the SCHEDULED ARRIVAL time at Bangkok Suvarnabhumi from Seoul Incheon was 1410hrs despite the SCHEDULED DEPARTURE time to Singapore being 1350hrs on the outbound flight (TG407). This means that the aircraft had ABSOLUTELY NO WAY of being on time for the TG407 & TG408 rotation because IT WAS ALREADY ROSTERED TO BE LATE. The on-time performance of the past week's TG408 flights according to flight tracking data, has been pathetically dismal. This flight was delayed by 75 min, but I have experienced a 12-hour delay when flying with them in 2022, on a 2-hour flight. Once onboard the aircraft, the wonderful service begins. The warmth of the cabin crew and their sincerity was felt almost instantly. The FAs were also courteous and professional. Food was average though. Despite the new aircraft (A350 & B787), the IFE system is still the same ones as those used on their older aircraft like the 777. The IFE system across the Boeing 777-300ER fleet appears to be at least 15 years old, has screens that are lagging terribly and are serious need of an overhaul. The ones on the A350 work fine though. Legroom/seat pitch is acceptable and decent without being generous or luxurious. The 777s had a footrest that was more of a hindrance rather than a help. In spite of its aged interior, the cabin appeared to be cleaned and sanitized well. Despite the warm touch from the cabin crew and their best efforts, Thai Airways is a serious letdown thanks to the poor management that is in charge of the scheduling and rostering of its aircraft. What used to be SouthEast Asia's second-best airline and second-largest fleet is now in shambles.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/THAI-1-1-500x500.jpg,A350-900 & Boeing 777-300ER,Business,Economy Class,Singapore to Hong Kong via Bangkok Suvarnabhumi,October 2024,3.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,4.0,no,negative,0.6005538105964661,5.923358917236328,CRT screen

21121,21121,Thai Airways,2,"""obnoxious resistance""",31st July 2023,True," Thai Airways used technology to replace various in flight and check in services without a correction/verification feature or providing human support for their technical error. Countless attempted contacts were made via phone calls and emails minutes after error was spotted, everyday for 2 consecutive weeks before trip took place. Assumed that I would be in the safe hand, but no, I was charged extra for no service provided and being held hostage for more payment at the airport check in counter by Thai airways operators. As Thai Airways operators claimed, they are not from the same department, they cannot offer a resolution, they do not know their system, and most unexpectedly they claimed they are not employees of Thai Airways! After hearing these from them, all I thought was to get out of that place immediately and never use them again. I made another payment again, repacked baggage, and dashed through the security clearance check points and the airport to my boarding with less than 1 hour as that operator held hostage to my check in bags. In all reasonable manners, airport manager was not empowered enough to manage the situation and their operators emotions; implemented technology should be well learned and supported if any system restrictions by the operators - obnoxious resistance result to failed implementation; and all passengers should be extended with a peace of mind in traveling, not being expected to pacify it's frustrating employees and dealt with their illiterate knowledge of its own system, and be able to answer why charging passenger when service was not provided to avoid the dispute and stay effective.

21198,21198,Thai Lion Air,1,"""no updates at all""",16th November 2019,True," Flying with Thai Lion Air is definitely the worst traveling experience in my entire life so far. I have no I idea how their business still survives to this day. I bought my ticket through Traveloka - a third party. I also purchased check in luggage in advance, together with the ticket although their charge for this was surprisingly expensive for a domestic flight from a low-cost airline. About 1 month prior to my departure date, I was informed that my flight had been rescheduled, which was totally no problem to me. However, on my departure date, I gave myself 2 hours in Don Mueang Airport. I kept looking at the screen and couldn't find any info about my flight number, which row to check in and so on. It was like the flight number SL 524 never existed. I checked my mobile app and e-mail again and again, no updates at all. Then I asked the ground staff, they looked at the confirmation and told me to keep queuing and waiting. I was supposed to depart at 4.00pm. Finally, my turn to check in at the counter came, it was about 3.00pm then. The check in staff of Thai Lion Air looked at me like I am an idiot. She took my passport away and came back about 5 minutes later. She told me that ""Madame, you flight time changed, Madame, 3.30pm, hurry up. No check in luggage now, cannot load. All carry-on Madame"". I was totally shocked, literally. She only gave me my passport and boarding pass and kept urging 'Hurry up, hurry up'. She didn't even give me the last minute passenger tag or something like that to let other departments prioritize my following steps before I could board my flight. And of course, no one from this airline accompanied my next steps. Only the hurry up yelling lady! I rushed to the security counter like never before. The nightmare continued, the departure time was coming so close and the security staff asked me to open my suitcase to check - skincare products, sunscreen and many other things. That was why I pre-purchased check-in luggage. Then I had a bunch of my stuff all thrown away at the security counter, continued running like hell to the gate. I was the last person to get on the plane as flight attendants whispering to each other ""Vietnamese"". How funny it was to be treated this way. Notified flight time change 30 minutes in advance, paid for check-in luggage, had a bunch of stuff thrown away then had to carry every single thing onto the aeroplane and even being sarcastically mocked for my nationality. And none of these was my fault. That day was a disaster. From the ground staff at Don Mueang Airport to the check in staff from Thai Lion Air, all showed absolutely fantastic responsibility and support! The tips with this airlines is very simple - don't fly with them. Their prices can be cheap, but if you go with them, be prepared for the nightmare ahead!",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/IMG_5757-e1573823859548-500x500.jpg,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Bangkok to Chiang Mai ,November 2019,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,negative,0.754012405872345,5.720163822174072,automated teller machine

And boarding on both flights was very smoothly handled and the outbound flight actually departed 15 minutes early. Interestingly, at Bangkok Airport, the runway from the air jetty was incredibly close, so much so that we taxied for just one minute and then took off. On board, the cabin crew, in their bright orange attire, greeted me politely with a 'sawadee ka' greeting, and despite their face masks, I could see a smile. The premium cabin with just 12 seats was in the usual Thai Airways colours. The seat pitch was an inch or so more than economy, and for an hours flight, it was fine. Before departure, a flight crew member took the meal order from each passenger, with a choice of two items - rice or noodles. On the outbound flight, I chose the chicken with rice, which came piping hot, so much so that the vegetables were in fact overcooked! On the return flight, it was noodles with shrimp. Small potions, but tasted delicious. No alcohol is served on domestic flights. Both flights were uneventful, on time, with nothing to complain about, and were a very enjoyable experience.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/THAI-SMILE-Thai-Smile-Plus-Premium-Economy-Cabin-500x454.jpg,A320,Business,Premium Economy,Bangkok to Chiang Rai,September 2022,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,,,4.0,yes,neutral,0.6627299189567566,4.948696613311768,passenger car

Flight from NCL to CUN was excellent, I had heard a lot about the 'Dreamliner' and thought it was just hype, turns out it really is a great aircraft. The cabin feels more spacious and the air quality much better than any aircraft I've flown on. As for the service, the cabin crew were attentive and had plenty of banter with the the passengers, the food was good and the entertainment system had a decent selection of films and movies to keep you occupied. The bar service was more than adequate, they came round an hour after we took off, served wine with dinner then another bar service later in the flight - you could go to the galley at any time to ask for a drink (on OB and IB flights they did start to run out of bar stock). The return flight was just as good, my partner and I had pre-booked the window and middle seats and ended up having no one sit in the aisle seat. Would most definitely recommend Thomson Airways if this airline is an option on the route you are flying. I flew BA to Orlando last year and this was a far better experience. Only thing I'll comment negatively on is he cleanliness of the planes, my tray table has stains on it and I could see that the whole aircraft could do with a deep clean - sort this out Thomson, you are flying state of the art aircraft that cost millions of pounds, keep them clean.

21781,21781,Titan Airways,8,"""no hesitation in recommending""",14th January 2020,True,"  Gatwick to Banjul . Surprisingly comfortable 6 hour journey to The Gambia for Christmas. The cabin was clean, crew were friendly and helpful and the flight was comfortable. I didn't suffer from my skin and eyes drying out as much as with other airlines. I got the feeling they didnt stint on the air quality. The food was fine and typical of airline food. There was plenty of water, juices, tea and coffee and you could buy booze if you wanted. The wines were very nice. Outward on 20 December we flew a Boeing 767 with 2-3-2 seating layout and on return 31 December it was an A320 with 3-3 seating. The seats on the A320 felt more spacious and comfortable although they had no adjustable headrest like the Boeing. We are both tall and it was no hardship. The time passed pretty quickly - perhaps also due to the decent times of the flights and the same time zone both ways. The only negative was the lack of working entertainment - although they have an app for your phone - it didnt work and headphones were not issued. Outward on the Boeing I was able to listen to their radio stations on my seat controls through my own earphones and on return I'd downloaded some movies on my mobile phone . I have no hesitation in recommending Titan Airways who I believe sub contract for other airlines when they are busy.

Thankfully there wasn’t much of a negative experience, everything from check-in to boarding to the inflight experience was prompt and precise, even if it weren’t spectacular. As TransNusa opts for a single-class layout, the aircraft has a capacity of 90 passengers seated in 18 rows of 5. The smaller capacity of the aircraft meant that boarding and disembarkation was completed fairly quickly and smoothly. Arguably the only sore point of the flight was having to use a bus to board the aircraft instead of using an aerobridge. TransNusa includes 15kg of checked bags as part of the basic air ticket so that’s a nice gesture to have. Despite having to land in heavy rain at KLIA, the entire journey was uneventful and decently pleasant, and it suggests that the COMAC ARJ21-700 will prove a contender in the regional small commercial jetliner market in the years to come.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/B9C48A57-D1E2-4C69-A80D-E8A949A48819-500x500.jpeg,COMAC ARJ21-700,Business,Economy Class,Jakarta to Kuala Lumpur,October 2023,4.0,5.0,,4.0,,,5.0,yes,positive,0.6736107468605042,6.74661111831665,airliner

We were checked in for our flight so quickly as we were called to an empty lane at CMF (their queues work differently there!). The staff were chatty and friendly. You are advised to go through security once called as there is not much on the other side. The queue was a bit long but we got moving within half an hour. After boarding, we had 20 minutes to relax until pushback. THE FLIGHT took off, and it was only five minutes late - rare that a TUI flight I go on is on time. The cabin service soon followed, but the rear trolley had to return to the galley as we had a lot of turbulence for the first half an hour. We descended and that turbulence went. The back trolley was back in service and we ordered our food. Unfortunately, they only had a bacon baguette or a ham and cheese toastie - in small numbers. Luckily, we were able to get two bacon baguettes. They were yummy, but a bit expensive. After that, there were final checks for the descent into Manchester. We were served well by the crew. Arrival Airport - We landed nice and punctual, but a little bottleneck happened as it said 'All bags will be delivered before 14.50'. Well, a little lie there as I only had one of my three bags by 14.50! The belt stopped and started again and we finally got all our bags around half an hour later.

Passengers to Amsterdam had to board first, while the passengers from Amsterdam to Aruba were asked to board second and fill up the remaining unassigned seats. The flight to Aruba was very quick (only 20 minutes) and no serviced was provided due to the short flight time. At Aruba the passengers to Amsterdam were asked to remain seated while the aircraft was prepared for its last leg to Amsterdam. After 90 minutes on the ground we departed slightly later then planned to Amsterdam. The seats were extremely narrow (this 767 was equipped with a 2-4-2 configuration, instead of the designed 2-3-2 configuration). Legroom was good, because we booked comfort class (a pitch of 33 inch), but the seats weren’t equipped with head rests. The interior looked also very dated due to the old overhead bins. The entertainment system was fine with a limited but good selection of movies and television series. After take-off dinner was served (chicken with onion sauce, which was not very good) with a non-alcoholic drink service, after which coffee or tea were served. The lights were dimmed (it was a night flight) and two hours before arrival breakfast was served (a croissant with a yoghurt and a drink).

Check-in was quite chaotic at Amsterdam, with multiple TUI departures at the same time and only one staff member trying to sent passengers to the right check-in row (check-in or bag drop-off). Boarding on the other hand was very smooth and efficient. I prebooked Economy comfort (34 inch leg space), seat 12A, which was quite comfortable. The seat was quite narrow though. The seat was equipped with an PTV with a pretty small selection of movies. A free headset and pillow were distributed. After take off the crew came around with a drink service (alcohol was charged), follow by a hot (small) meal with a drink and coffee or tea. During the flight it was possible to order paid snacks or drinks, but there were also two complementary drink rounds. Two hours before landing a sandwich with a slice of cake were handed out, which was really tasteful. The flight itself was uneventful, and the crew was really friendly and professional.

Everything seemed to be very disorganized. The aircraft arrived early on Crete which ment also an early departure and arrival for us. The plane was around 9 years old and owned by TUIfly.

The flight was booked via a travel agency with a baggage allowance of 20kg and onboard service included. When booking TUIfly it is very important to see whats included in your flight as many differences excist (from 15kg to 20kg for checked bags, free snack and drink on board or for extra charges). Online check-in was already possible 30 days in advance and easy. The computer is deciding about your seats, filling the plane from the back to the front. So if you don't like your assigned seats just wait a while and try to check-in again, because a seatchange will cost you EUR13 per person and segment. For dropping of bags in the morning two counters were open and a long queue in front of them. It took around 40 mins to line up. Aircraft was parked on a remote stand. Departure was delayed by 15-20 mins without any Information given on board (2 passengers came late). Later on routing and current landing time were given frequently. During the service, flight attendants ask you if you have snack and drink included (printed on a separate boarding card) or you like to purchase anything from the café menu in your seatpocket (if there). We had a choice between a bun with cheese or ham which was ok but nothing special and could choose between coffee, tea or a softdrink. Good thing: softdrinks are handed over in a 0,5 liter bottle with a cup. Duty free shopping followed. Crew average, neither friendly or unfriendly. Nothing special to remember. As the plane was ex Sunexpress the seats looked different and after nearly 3 hours of flight I felt quite cramped and it was hard to move. No entertainment or airshow was shown, only the safety video on cabin screens.

In all other ways this was a truly dismal experience. Check-in was surly to say the least and, given how empty the plane was, very slow. Tunis airport is in serious need of some TLC. It feels cramped and hot and there are remarkably few areas to sit down airside. Onboard the seats were filthy, old and disgusting. Perhaps once the blue leather might have seemed like a good idea, but not any more. The seatback table was filthy. The food, when it came, was delivered with the same surly disinterest as the rest of the service. And it was disgusting. The aircraft was kept at an uncomfortably high temperature. But most shocking was the incapacity of the crew to contain the passengers. On departure there were children in the aisles, window shades down and seats reclined. the moment we landed people were pulling things out of the overhead bins without any intervention from the crew. Baggage took ages to arrive and Tunisair operates into T4 at LHR which meant a twenty minute wait to cross the runway on the way in and a long wait to get a train back to the central area.

22182,22182,Tunisair,7,"""flight was overall pleasant""",13th July 2016,False," Frankfurt to Tunis. On-line Check-in was possible through the Tunisair website. The website had issues being available at some hours of the day during that period (the TU server did not respond). Once accessed though, the procedure was fast and simple. There was no information on lounge access on the electronic boarding pass, so proceeded to the check-in area at FRA. TU Check-in area is in Zone C of Terminal 1 and is handled by AHS. When asked about lounge access, the AHS agent did not seem to know at first. I was then directed to use the Priority pass lounge located in the first floor, area C, before the security area, which is most inconvenient. The lounge was partially under construction. Very basic commodities, poor food quality - potato salad, potato soup and frankfurter sausages. Lousy internet reception of the main FRA internet access provided freely through T-mobile. only salvation was a good coffee machine. Left the lounge early to ensure I go through security and immigration procedures on time before boarding. Boarding was handled by bus (most times for TU out of FRA). Boarding was smooth, although no announcements were made to ensure boarding by zones / classes and for families with kids, rather a general announcement was made for a general boarding, of a full flight. Aircraft was a A319. Business class configuration was 2-2 with larger and seemingly more comfortable seats than economy class seats. It is a plus for this type of leg. LH and other TU flights on this leg offer a 3-3 regular economy class configurations with a blocked seat in the middle. The aircraft looked tired, dirty floors and dirty walls and panels. There is a PTV in the arm rest, which I did not try, so I am not sure if it worked. Now that catering is back to Tunisair, the meal service was good for this type of flight, with a salad (smoked salmon, mushroom), a hot offering with a selection of a beef or a seafood dish. I chose the seafood option, which was quite tasty and nice. Meal service was accompanied with a beverage service. Champagne, wines were offered. TU serves Piper Heidsieck Rosé at this time of the day. A great choice. Although the crew member was nice throughout the meal service (there was only one crew member working the Business class section of 12 passengers), she seemed to be a bit overwhelmed, forgetting requests for beverage re-fills etc. There was a single beverage service throughout the meal, until coffee. Not even another offering of water. The meal service was overall good considering the length of the flight. Overall the crew members were nice, smiling and very helpful. What ever imperfection I noted, I would attribute to a lack of training and the absence of clear direction as to how to handle a meal service. This is truly a flaw in the quality system of the airline and lack of training. Not blaming crew members as individuals. All announcements were made in Arabic and German. Nothing in English, including the safety announcements and demonstration. English should be added. Another illustration of breakdown in SOPs and lack of quality systems. This flight was overall pleasant. Tunisair has potential.

22271,22271,Turkish Airlines,1,"""I will not recommend Turkish Airlines""",12th January 2025,True,"   Almost none of the passengers got their luggage when we landed. Had to go back to the airport myself at my own cost to look for my luggage several days in a row. When I found the first suitcase, no one controled whether the suitcase I picked up really belonged to me. During the four days I was at the airport looking for suitcases, new suitcases kept arriving that the airline had ""lost"" - probably in Istanbul.  There was no help  when calling customer service to claim the luggage. They had different stories every time we called and blamed the previous customer service agent for lying. Some spoke such bad English that we couldn't understand what they were saying. One suitcase was broken when it arrived, but we got a new one. Satisfied with the solution. We had booked emergency exits on all four flights due to the fact that my traveling companion has very long legs. All our seat reservations were changed due to a change of flight type. After some discussion, he was given emergency exits on all flights. The staff at the airport in Istanbul were not very service minded and forced us to check in the one hand luggage we had with us (which we are allowed to have with us according to your own guidelines) despite the fact that it contained important possessions. The airport in Istanbul required a new security check, so the drink I had bought at the airport in Oslo had to be thrown away. Other airports do not run new security checks when we arrive from Norway or from airports that come under the EU's directives as these places already have strict guidelines for security checks. A large airport with long distances as well as time-consuming security check, makes me to avoid Istanbul on all subsequent flights. I will probably choose transfer through European airports such as Schipol. Positive sides: The airplane was okay. Flight attendants were polite and helpful. Totally ok food. I will not recommend Turkish Airlines to anyone. It is the worst flight experience I have ever had.

The crew didn’t even bother to do a basic wipe down of the seats, this is extremely disgusting and potentially hazardous. To make matters worse, the spacing between the seat rows were extremely congested and uncomfortable compared to their counterparts, their TVs were glitching and freezing every 5 minutes, and their menu options were VERY limited with no snacks served beforehand. The service in general was very subpar.

The ground crew was good and helped me board the flight according to standard procedures. The seating was pretty good; even though it was Economy Class, I was sitting in Economy Plus, the same seating as Economy Class but with more legroom. The cabin crew were all friendly people, even though we had moderate turbulence that made everyone anxious. However, my only issue is that the food did not meet today's standard for Economy Class. The entree portion was too small, and they didn't notify the mobile app for a last-minute change. I thought I would have a chicken entree because I had reviewed it via United's mobile app. But instead, when I was onboard, I had beef, which confused me.

The flight itself was uneventful, and the seat was comfortable and fully functional. The entertainment options, unfortunately, were extensive and varied, keeping me up for almost the entire duration of the flight and I arrived in Frankfurt... groggy and tired. Every time I fly on United, the amenity kits keep changing. This time, it was the bright red Wrexham AFC container. Nothing spectacular inside though. Dining options consisted of: Romaine kale salad Appetizer: chilled ginger beef or sliced watermelon radish. Dinner: pork cutlet, chicken fricassee, seared cod, or roasted balsamic butter cauliflower. I had the chicken fricassee and it was great, but I was already full from United's Polaris Lounge in Chicago. Dessert: ice cream sundae, lemon berry cheesecake, and assorted cheese plate.

From beginning to end, it was such a hassle for a 25 minute flight. At BWI, they insisted that you check in at a kiosk to obtain a boarding pass prior to check in. Despite telling them it was an international flight with a transfer connection and one party was on a wheelchair, they still insisted. The kiosk rejected my attempts, wasting about 20 minutes of my time. At check in, the staff were rude and insisted that my bags were over the weight limit despite travelling in on a business class ticket. Finally, she relented, printed off my boarding pass only to have it rejected by the TSA agent as the bar code was not printed properly. Then there was no one to push the wheelchair for my travelling partner so I took it upon myself to do so as they were closing the flight. I was told off by the check in agent for not arriving earlier but I pointed out that we had been there on time but wasted 20 minutes at the kiosk and another 20 minutes queuing to check in.

At the airport, there was no clear line or queue system for check-in and baggage drop-off. Passengers were crowding chaotically, and the staff did nothing to manage the situation or maintain order. As a result, we waited for over 2 hours just to drop off our luggage and get our boarding passes. The disorganization continued inside the plane. Passengers were not guided properly, leading to confusion and delays during boarding. The cabin crew seemed overwhelmed and did little to assist or streamline the process. This lack of efficiency made the entire experience stressful and exhausting. I travel frequently, and I have never encountered such poor management at an airport or on a flight. Uzbekistan Airways needs to improve its ground and onboard operations significantly to provide a better experience for passengers. Clear lines, better staff training, and effective communication would go a long way in resolving these issues. I hope the airline takes this feedback seriously and works on improving its services. Until then, I would hesitate to fly with Uzbekistan Airways again.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/IMG_7579-500x500.png,,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Tashkent to Istanbul,February 2025,5.0,5.0,5.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,no,negative,0.907827377319336,4.931553363800049,high-speed train

Due to the fact that the online checkin wasn't possible, not on the website nor on their app, we had to be early at the airport to make sure, we were seated next to each other. From the moment, my girlfriend and I, entered the air vessel, we were welcomed with a smile and notice some Spanish extra cabin crew members to the staff of the flight HY272 as well as the Uzbeki who also served us in English. Our 2 seats, on the left side, were spacious, the meal was suprisingly very varied and rich of side dishes such as extra fruit, dessert, some burek, sauces such as ketchup, olive oil and mustard. We were served many times with drinks during the flight. The cabin crew were very available, very caring and had a really nice level of customer service. This air vessel had the problem of non working screen entertainments. Keep that in mind if you are taking a 4,5 hour flight or longer. Also some of the locals don't really care about queueing  correctly, as entering the plane as well as embarking the plane, even we noticed them being a bit rude towards the airplane staff. Also I have to confirm, the entire staff showed the safety flight procedures, so they value the safety on board.

22657,22657,Uzbekistan Airways,1,"""Safety was not a priority for cabin crew on this flight""",7th November 2021,True," Very disappointed with Uzbekistan Airways service, from boarding until landing in Tashkent. Booked flight with my kids from DXB-TAS on the 7th of November. It started at the airport in DXB, where I requested to get seats in the forward cabin, as it is challenging with small kids to move with luggage all the way to the end of the cabin. The ground staff asked the supervisor if he could offer us forward cabin seats, he refused. He was rude not only with me but with the poor ground staff who was trying to tell him the correct procedure. I have flown many times with Uzbekistan Airways and I have noticed that he has been super rude with passengers and staff at all times (in Dubai and Sharjah). When I came onboard, surprisingly I noticed that there were so many empty seats in the forward cabin! So why did he refuse a mother with 2 small kids to offer a comfort? I assume he is backed up by someone, because this kind of unacceptable attitude for so many years and nobody takes any action! Inflight: - Safety was not a priority for cabin crew on this flight, for take off some windows were dimmed, some were bright - I had two obese passengers sitting through the aisle (35E,F) for take off with their seatbelts were not fastened. Grooming of the crew was extremely poor, especially 2 crew who were seated in L3/R3 door. Male crew who worked from the AFT was not interested to serve us and other passengers, he spoke to us as if we were at the military and he was the general with us, soldiers. When he was serving lunch, somebody asked him for a glass of water, he said that he only has white wine on top of his cart. When I asked him what chicken was served with, he had difficulty in answering. He saw me struggling during disembarkation with kids and my luggage, he didn't even offer to assist us to disembark the aircraft - Not to mention that lavatories were dirty throughout the flight. On this flight the crew didn't smile and welcome guests, they all gave impression that they were forced to come and do this flight, except one who was super positive and welcoming from boarding. During the flight she came and checked on us if we needed anything. Sadly, she was the only crew who worked and valued her job.

Boarding process was a bit chaotic, the plane was full and there was no separate line for business class so it took a while for agents to check documents and boarding passes of everyone in the long queues until I was allowed to board. 3 friendly flight attendants greeted me aboard the beautiful cabin of their new Boeing 787, took me to my assigned seat, hung my jacket, and offered me some champagne, with a refill shortly after. They spoke very good English and were genuine friendly and courteous. They distributed noise-canceling headphones, newspapers and magazines, a cool amenities kit - a nice touch since this was a 5-hours flight - and the landing forms, plus informed lunch would be served shortly after takeoff. Cabin was very nice with ambient lighting and logos and touches of Uzbekistan Airways. Seat was very comfortable but not as private as if it was on a 2-2-2 configuration. Since I had an empty seat next to me, I had all the privacy plus lots of additional space. Right after takeoff, a flight attendant came to offer hot towels, additional drinks with a few small plates, and a food feast began. Several courses were served and I was very impressed by the quantity and quality of the food presented. Even though they did not offer a printed menu, stewardess brought several choices of appetizers, salads, soups, main courses, and encouraged me to try different combinations. Also the desserts, I agreed with two choices, but they brought more and everything was high quality and well prepared and presented in porcelain with Uzbekistan colors and logos, very classy. Shortly after lunch, they offered a tablet with several movies and music programs to choose from. Flight attendants keept checking passengers by offering more drinks, blankets, etc. until Captain has announced the approach to Tashkent. After landing, they went to every passenger to thank them for flying with Uzbekistan and to welcome to their country. As the airplane parked at a remote stand, a bus assigned to business class passengers took us to a private arrival lounge, where private immigration and customs facilities were offered, and the whole process went quite fast.

Plenty of upgrades as a result as economy overbooked. The plane was old not very comfy for sleeping. The 767 before was much better and even so not a full flat seat it was alright to sleep.

There was a choice of 2 meals - most people chose the pork for dinner and omelette for breakfast. I had no complaints over the quality of the food, but the meals weren't really child friendly. The only complaints I had was that my inflight entertainment was not working. I tried resetting it 3 times as instructed by a cabin crew member and crew members also tried resetting it without success. I solved the problem by swapping seats with my wife who wanted to sleep. There were plenty of movies to keep entertained. If you're using your own single pin set of headphones, you will need to bring an adaptor to suit the 2 pin airline plug, or use the headphones provided. The second complaint that I have (Which is out of Vietnam Airlines' control) is that the Australian Government has instructed Vietnam Airlines and the Vietnam Government to not allow passengers to bring water (even bottled water) onto the flight. (Despite passengers being able to purchase fruit at shops at the gate....) The crew provided 1 bottle of Australian bottled water on the flight, as well as top ups (when requested) during the flight. In Sydney, all of our bags were delivered in a reasonable time. I have read many reviews from people complaining that their checked bags have been lost. My family and I have travelled the world and not lost a single bag. Here is my advice: 1: Arrive at the airport on time with plenty of time to spare and use the manned check in counters - not the automated self service baggage drops. 2: Make sure that all tags and stickers (the small barcode labels) that have been stuck on your bags from previous flights have been removed before handing your bags to check in staff. Most airports (especially large ones) use automated systems to direct your bags to the area / bins they need to go to. If old tags are on your bags and are misread by scanners - this may cause your bag(s) to be spat out of the system leading to errors in the destination / flight they are sent to. 3: Wait a few moments and watch your bag move down the belt from the check in counter. I have read many complaints about crew members not being friendly. We have never had any issues with crew members being rude to us. We are polite to crew members and greet them when we are boarding and are aware that W they are not our personal servants. We are also aware that people from different cultures have different personalities and views of acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Crew members may seem a bit offish for a number of reasons: Their confidence in speaking English may be low. They don't understand what you are saying (or understand a joke). You have been rude to them. (If someone is rude to me, then I'm not going to be to friendly with them...) They are very busy dealing with more important things than what you asked. If I am flying economy - I have expectations that any meals (especially on short flights) will be basic and not the 3 courses that you would expect in business or first class. It is important to follow instructions from crew members as this is the law also.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vietnam-Airlines-A350-Economy-33a-500x500.jpeg,A350,Family Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh to Sydney,October 2024,3.0,5.0,3.0,5.0,3.0,,5.0,yes,positive,0.6256807446479797,4.607648849487305,desktop computer

The cabin had a bright and spacious feel to it and plenty of room between seats - even when the person front fully relined his seat. The seats that my family and sat in were quite tired and they were aging - i wouldn't want to sit in the seat I had for more than 2 hours, as the cushioning was quite worn out - especially in the lumbar area. My son who was sitting behind me bumped my seat a few times and I felt it. The aircraft was clean, but it's paintwork was looking pretty tired. Vietnam Airlines colours look beautiful on freshly painted aircraft, unfortunately these colours fade quickly. The 2 hour flight left 30 minutes late due to the aircraft not being available for some reason and we arrived into Ho Chi Minh City 30 minutes late. Onboard service overall was pretty poor (The crew were friendly and professional) - all we were offered for a 2 hour flight was a cup (yes - 1 small cup) of water, some sort of sponge food with a 50ml bottle of yakult bacteria. Jetstar offer more. Overall - service for tourist class economy passengers really did feel third class - like they do on Qantas and airlines in the US - express line for their favorite passengers and 1 slow moving line for the rest of us to board. Pennypinching was evident as when we arrived in Ho Chi Minh City, the aircraft parked at a remote stand and we had to wait for those dreaded buses. Business passengers had one to themselves, the rest of us were squeezed into 2 other buses like sardines. Baggage - Business class passengers received their bags within 10 minutes of arrival. The rest of us were waiting at least 20 minutes for our bags. All 4 of our bags arrived safely. My opinion of Vietnam Airlines has slipped a bit as a result of this flight. Hopefully tomorrow night's flight home to Australia on their A350 aircraft will lift my opinion again.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Vietnam-Airlines-787-Premium-Economy-Seat-Room-500x500.jpeg,B787-900,Family Leisure,Premium Economy,Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City,October 2024,3.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,yes,positive,0.5282981991767883,6.399416446685791,seat belt

Various people complained and were moved to other seats but it seems to not have made a difference. The flight attendants were running up and down trying to sort this out for various people who spoke up while also trying to serve meals. This is not their fault and re-setting a few times did nothing. The meals were good, the Asian one more strongly spiced and not bland.

There was no entertainment from KL to Hanoi as the plane was a little dated but with comfortable seats but the flight from Hanoi to Seoul was even better. The plane was brand new with good entertainment selection, it was a comfortable flight. Even with my returning flight Seoul - HCM - KL, it was as good as the one I went to Seoul.

I am travelling with this airline with connection time more than 12 hours. And I actually suffer to just wait outside the boarding gate during this period. No crew from Vietnam Airlines guiding. No food and beverages provided as promised. No transit tour provided as broadcast. How can this airline nominated as 4 star airline with such poor service. Before my flight, I actually contacted the airlines and was assure that the staff will take guide me through when I arrived Hanoi Airport. At the end, no one knows. I go to the airline connection flight counter, no one there. Go to LOTUS Lounge, said not entitled to. Felt I am paying for 4 star airlines and treated as in I am taking budget airlines. The flight VN531 was also very terrible. Is just a budget craft without inflight entertainment and small seat. Luckily I didn't upgrade to business class when checked in because the business class is actually just a curtain away from economy class. Trust me, I shocked when I onboard the flight just now. The flight supposed to fly at 3.25pm, but only move at 4pm. Supposed to arrived at 6.55pm, at the end arrived at 7.30pm. I wonder the flight duration took longer than estimated because the flight is old? Very huge turbine noise when the flight flying up. Anyway, I just felt blessed that I arrived safely. Conclusion, I paid for so called 4 star flight but ended with budget airlines service. Listen to me, I am writing now while overnight at Departure Gate of Hanoi Airport.

22852,22852,Vietnam Airlines,7,"""promising airline with dedicated staff""",2nd March 2023,True,"  Vietnam Airlines is a promising airline with dedicated staff, but there are a few operational and infrastructural issues that hold the airline back. Call center and website deficiencies need work, however it redeems itself in the air. My first interaction for this trip which was the website to manage my booking to select my seat and special meal request did not work as it was a Delta ticket using miles, so I did not get the best first impression. Subsequently, I called the call center in Vietnam to order my special meal and was informed that no meals were provided for both legs of my flight. Fast forward to the flight, meals were served on both legs which left me vexed by the misinformation. Airport experience was standard, but the employees didn’t seem too well versed on the procedures as important ones such as making a boarding announcement and reassigning seats after ticket issuance seemed unfamiliar to the staff. I also did not enjoy the double security I had to undergo since my itinerary had a connecting flight and needed to swap terminals when transiting in Hanoi. On the flipside, the airline got some things right. Albeit being unable to order a special meal, the standard ones served were fantastic! There was even bubble tea sold for a modest $2 USD! The inflight crew did a fine job, not exceeding nor falling below expectations on this red eye flight and the entertainment had some good choices. Overall, not a bad airline, but they have some work to do with fine tuning staff training and fixing the poor website.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230302_023459-500x500.jpg,A350 / Boeing 787-9,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Ho Chi Minh City to Busan via Hanoi,March 2023,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,4.0,yes,negative,0.6563047766685486,5.735142707824707,plate

I do have a few minor problems with how my flight went and the care given to my luggage though. The smallest detail that got on my nerves was the fact that everything had to be paid by card, so if you're on a six hour flight with cash, make sure you eat before. They did give complimentary drinks once during the flight but that's all. Another little bug is that they had a very small selection of pretty much everything, entertainment-wise and food-wise. Again, these are just small tweaks that made my flight the tiniest bit worse, but the most important thing I mentioned was the care given to my luggage.

It’s April 2, 2024 and I’m still at the airport to board another flight as I’ve never seen such an irresponsible set of staff. It was a day when many Vistara flights were delayed or either cancelled. When they were not onboarding even after 7pm, when we asked the officer at the gate, he informed that the flight is delayed and will take off by 11:30pm. Till we asked, no updates were given by the Vistara staffs. The flight status was showing “on time” and “security” even at 8pm. The flight arranged dinner for us and by 11:50pm, we were on-boarded to the flight. But the flight didn’t take off even at 12:30am on April 2, 2024. When checked with the cabin crew, they informed that the captain of the flight parked the flight and went away. Now only first officer is available. And they are waiting for another captain to come and take the flight. The cabin crew also has been waiting since 6pm on April 1, 2024. Then the first officer (very helpful and gentle man) informed us that by 1:15am he will inform us the decision of the flight is going or getting cancelled. By 1:30am we were informed the flight is rescheduled to 5am. When we asked for confirmation that f the flight, they said they cannot confirm until 4am. Only then they can know if any captain can come and fly the plane to Kochi. So they de-boarded us from the plane and we were sent to the arrival area to reclaim our baggage. In the flight we were informed if we need a refund, it will be done at the arrival. When we reached the arrival, we came to know that no such information is given to the arrival. So we strongly asked for a cancellation and confirmation on refund. They were not willing to give the confirmation. I said I need the confirmation of refund. Finally the staff at the arrival got a WhatsApp message of my PNR full refund confirmation. I booked another Indigo flight to Kochi at 10:10am and I’m at the airport since yesterday 6pm. Just now while typing this message, I got a call from Vistara that the flight which was supposed to leave at 5am did not go yet and now they are ready to fly to Kochi. I asked what was the purpose of the call? They informed me the flight is only left with 6 passengers (it was almost a full flight) and if we are willing, they are ready to take us. I said no. Had they properly updated all passengers from time to time, they could have avoided this issue and such a hat-redness towards this airlines. I was supposed to reach my home at 10:30pm yesterday.

I fly this route a lot, usually with Emirates or Qatar and had read some good things so thought I’d try out Vistara business class. The fun started at boarding in Dhaka where there was no business priority and an approx. hour queue to clear security in to the gate where three separate flights were taking off from. Dhaka is an old airport with security at the gates but other airlines manage it just fine. There was only one Vistara employee checking boarding cards and when I asked him about Business priority and told him I would miss the flight he just shrugged and walked off. I only made the flight by taking my life in my hands and queue jumping, nearly causing a riot in the process. The flight Dhaka to Delhi is Premium economy not business - the seat is even labelled as such. Transfer at Delhi very odd - despite having a boarding pass I was escorted to the transfer desk to be given another one. I couldn’t access the WiFi as I hadn’t been sent the code I apparently needed (and no one on board has any). And then having paid $20 for it; it cut off halfway through (despite being advertised as ‘whole flight’) and I had to pay again! And then to cap it off, on arrival at Heathrow the business class bags came off last rather than first, which felt like a good summation of the whole experience.

But he still insisted that the fishing net can not be brought on-board and also that they could not provide any form or document showing that the object was confiscated by VivaAerobus Cancún Station. They waited until the very end of the boarding and then bullying us that if we did not leave the net behind the would deny us the boarding.

23309,23309,VivaAerobús,1,"""They are unreliable""",6th November 2021,True,"  I had a flight from Tijuana to Puerto Escondido on November 5th. First, they delayed the flight a few days before, which is pretty typical of them. When I was in the terminal everyone was confused on which flights were flying from which gate and there were no employees there to help at the kiosks. After an hour of being in the terminal I was able to find my gate, which wasn't showing the correct information or have someone manning the kiosk. When the flight was delayed another hour, no one told all of us waiting through any means of communication, we all had to swarm the attendant when he walked by. Our flight was delayed another hour and an hour after that it was canceled. The front kiosk gave everyone a number to call, which did not work and told everyone to go to the front check in to ask questions. I waited for three hours to talk to someone at the front desk and literally all she gave me was the same faulty phone number and as option to have my flight for 11.30pm 2 nights later. Everyone was upset and some people had their flights canceled two nights in a row and no compensation for the inconvenience. I didn't trust the airline to actually have a flight that would be reliable so I flew back home from San Diego. VivaAerobus claimed the reason for the cancellation was the fog, but I literally flew out of San Diego a few hours later, an hour away. Some planes were still landing at Tijuana and there wasn't much fog. The worst part was trying to get a hold of the company. I had been calling and trying different menus for hours in the airport and talking in circles with the bot. Whenever I got a hold of someone, they would transfer me and drop my call. Terrible communication and it's impossible to get a real person.

It's only an attempt to charge you extra. I had a backpack and a ukulele with me. I was told at the check in counter that the ukulele was fine. Then in this second bag check line the guy said I had to pay a $599 peso fee ($30 USD) for special handling of the instrument. I was not happy about this as the instrument is much smaller than the majority of the carry ons that people had. I didn't have a choice, the instrument wasn't even mine, I was bringing it for a friend. I paid the fee thinking they were going to put it somewhere secure for me. No, I showed the stewardess my receipt and she said just put it in the overhead. Seriously? Then what was the fee for? I put it in the overhead and it fit perfectly front to back. They were just making a grab for extra fees. I was angry, I should have never gotten in that line. I have messaged Viva Aerobus asking for a refund. I doubt I get it. I will try to dispute the charge with my card, because you can't charge a ""special handling fee"" and do nothing for it.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211104_102937-500x500.jpg,,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Guadalajara to Puerto Vallarta,November 2021,2.0,1.0,,1.0,,,1.0,no,negative,0.5327557325363159,6.409383296966553,mail bag

On the way back from Medellin to Bogota, they refused to allow me to carry on the same luggage I flew into Medellin with, and insisted on charging me $40 CAD to bring my luggage on board. They were more than happy to have me miss my flight, until I had paid their ransom. The legroom on this flight was absolutely non existent (see photo). This has been the worst airline I have ever flown with (and I've flown Ryanair). If you're looking to save money by flying with this airline, I would suggest that you book somewhere else, because at the end of the day, you'll still end up paying the same amount.

Decided as well to fly from Antwerp as they offered reasonable prices for their flights, while my usual airlines I usually take from Amsterdam or Rotterdam were extremely expensive for just flying of less than a hour. Arriving a touch early at Antwerp Airport, check-in and security were quite quiet, so it was just a matter of a few minutes to pass both check-in and security, while waiting to board (Very small airport, so don't expect much to do after security.) Once the aircraft was ready to board, it was just 15 minutes to be fully ready to start up and depart. The Fokker 50 they were using was surprisingly neat and clean from the inside for an aircraft of this age and was quite spacious to stand in the aisle. After an on-time departure out of Antwerp, the flight was quite smooth and the flight attendant started to serve us with a complimentary drink and snack of your choosing, while the flight crew kept us up to date about their procedure into London City and the estimated time of arrival, which to me was well done. Turbulence appeared into approach of London and landing was on-time. The most surprising factor of the flight was that the noise was quite low for a turboprop within the cabin. After a on-time landing, the boarding was quickly done in a safe and mannerly matter and all that was left was to wait for our luggage to arrive on our belt, which probably was the longest wait.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/20180709_174148-1-500x500.jpg,Fokker 50,Business,Economy Class,Antwerp to London City,July 2018,3.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,,,4.0,yes,neutral,0.7607339024543762,5.959488868713379,airliner

She was not that comfortable with her English, and nobody was speaking English in that airport for that matter! I put the charge on my credit card because I didn’t want to miss my flight and couldn’t communicate with lady at the checkin counter. I noticed that other passengers were carrying their carry -on luggage (the same size as mine) to the airplane and didn’t pay any fee. Furthermore, since it was an international flight, I could have checked in my carry- on at no charge which is customary with international flights.

I brought a backpack with me as hand luggage and, despite it fitted in the basket for luggage to be put under your seat, they asked me to pay 60 EUR x 2 legs = 120 EUR as according to them it did not fit well in the basket. I refused to pay and I had to book another flight. I would advise other travelers from Vueling with hand luggage who believe that they should not pay for their hand luggage to get on board as soon as possible. Why? Because it Vueling staff get abusive, there would be many witnesses who can also record with their mobile phones what is happening. Also if they get abusive and start discussing with a passenger, then the flight would delay because of them. Otherwise, if you are boarding the last one like me, they can just ask you to pay any amount even if your hand luggage fits the required measurements.

23648,23648,Vueling Airlines,1,“made TWO botched attempts at landing”,27th November 2023,True," Booked a short one-way flight from Barcelona to Bilbao. Our incompetent pilot made TWO botched attempts at landing and was unable to do, blaming the weather. However, according to arrivals data from the Bilbao airport, several other flights landed just fine within a few minutes of when our flight's incompetent or impaired pilot could not do so. I think the BIO Tower wisely refused to give him a THIRD try at endangering the lives of passengers and he had to turn the plane around and return back to BCN. I then had to take a grueling 7 hr bus ride to get to Bilbao 9.5 hrs later than scheduled. I emailed Vueling demanding a refund, and got an automated reply stating, ""We confirm that we have received your message. We have taken note of your comments and we have forwarded them to the relevant department to take the appropriate measures."" It's been a MONTH since then and no other response. I tried calling their ""Customer Service"" line in Spain - they have NO toll-free or USA phone number, so it will cost you - only to get endlessly looped in their automated phone system multiple times, or told ""Please hold for an agent."" and then their system would immediately drop the call. Reading other reviews here and elsewhere, it is apparently Vueling's policy to simply play dead and keep your money.

Three were huge lines and only 3/4 open desks. We waiting for a while just for checking in, because it wasn’t possible to make in online. Moreover, it was not possible to make in the automatic machine. The people, that were standing near me in line missed their previous flight, also with Vueling, because after they have been waited for more than hour in a line, they were told that they’re late, however it was 20 minutes before boarding. After all of this stress, my sister wasn’t admitted to a flight, because she hasn’t an individual passport. However, she was added in my mum’s passport and also has a Birth Certificate, and as far as we’re Ukrainians and during the war it’s possible for children to travel without passport, but being in the parent’s passport, the desk worker said it’s not possible with their airline and advised us just to go on the train or bus. We were on holidays in Spain, but live in the Netherlands since the war started, so we were going home. Also, we have been already traveling by plane with the same mum’s passport, where was my sister and the Birth Certificate (as well we went to Spain from Amsterdam). But the worker was even after explanations so hopeless and mean. Then she just threw away our tickets, didn’t even ask if someone from my family still planning to go on a flight (there were me, 2 younger sisters and parents). So we asked again to make new tickets for me and my another sister, what took also a bit of time. My parents and the second sister left in airport without any support, explanation what they should to do and of course without a refund. That’s just crazy!

23722,23722,Wamos Air,2,"""the service was horrible"" ",8th August 2023,True,"  This review is for the return leg of my trip from Los Angeles to Medellin on an Avianca flight operated by Wamos Air. Specifically, the BOG to LAX portion of the return trip. The flight starts off well enough: you are warmly greeted and handed a card signed by two flight attendants (FA) with warm wishes, etc. From there, it only goes downhill. Service was very hit-and-miss, mostly miss. It's as if the FA's are trying to check off items on a list than actually provide service. Meal service took a very long time from start to finish considering the number of business class seats and the the number of FA's. No one came by to check on you, ie refill your drink or offer more bread, etc. The FA's already did it and checked it off their list, no need to do it again. If you are overlooked during meal service oh well, it's not on the checklist to make sure, oh well. During my flight, my AV system was broken. I pressed the call light to let a FA know, but no one responded. When a FA did respond the second time I pressed the call light, he said he would go reset the system, but never did. It got so bad that the flight attendant sitting next to me deadheading to LA had to flag a FA down to have my AV system finally reset. The first reset didn't seem to be working, but the FA never bothered to check back, so I had to flag a FA again to have the AV system reset. The FA just didn't really seem to care. They were happiest when they were all congregating in the galley, hiding behind the curtain. Getting back to the food, you are handed a menu at the beginning of the flight, but I am not sure why. during meal service, they ran out of my main course selection and my dessert selection. I would say it was bad luck, but on the flight to BOG, Wamos Air ran out of my appetizer selection and main course selection too. My advice is to sit as close to the front of the aircraft as possible since meal service starts at the front of the plane. Speaking of the plane, in addition to the multiple broken AV systems, the footrest on my chair was broken. So when the chair was fully extended position, it felt as if I was slowly sliding off since the chairs were not completely lie flat. The monitor was not adjustable, so if you are above a certain height, you just have to deal with the glare. The bathroom reeked and was never cleaned during the flight, must not have been on their checklist. Overall, the service was horrible, the airplane was in need of maintenance, and the food was mediocre. Definitely, not a business-class product, maybe premium economy if you use your imagination.",https://www.airlinequality.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_6202-500x500.jpeg,A330,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Bogota to Los Angeles ,July 2023,2.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,,2.0,no,neutral,0.8039889335632324,6.142582893371582,CRT screen

This is not to mention that the checkup takes forever and in the meantime they mistreat you severely. (The staff is very unqualified). After checking in, they issue me my 4 boarding passes and the seats are assigned to me with numbers and letters, leaving them all together. Later, minutes before boarding the plane, an airline staff approached me in a very disrespectful manner, without giving me any explanation, they asked me for the boarding pass that they had issued to me and arbitrarily changed my seats, completely separating my family. They leave my wife with one of my children in a middle seat in row 3 and they put me in a middle seat in row 4. The worst part is that I had paid an additional amount to choose my seats and this way to be all together; I tried to demand some explanation and they just told me it's like this or you don't travel, this is not negotiable and that's it, they turned around and left me talking alone. Immediately after boarding the plane, I spoke with the flight attendant explaining my situation and asking him to help me solve it since my children did not understand why they had been separated from their mother, to which they only responded that we cannot do anything, this is a Low airline.

Lo peor del caso es que yo habia pagado una cantidad adicional para elegir mis asientos y de esta manera estar todos juntos; trate de exigir alguna explicación y solo me dijeron es asi o no viajas esto no es negociable y punto se voltearon y me dejaron hablando solo. Seguidamente después de abordar el Avion converse con el personal de sobrecargo explicandole mi situación y solicitándole me ayude a resolver ya que mis hijos no entendían porque los habian separado de su madre, a lo cual solo me respondieron no podemos hacer nada esto es una aerolínea Low Cost, lo cual es totalmente falso porque te cobran hasta por respirar, y los tickets son carísimos, en lo que si son bastante Low es en el trato al pasajero y en los servicios que prestan, en eso si son very very low.

23776,23776,Wingo,1,"""forced to pay for a carry-on""",26th September 2024,True,"   My recent experience with this airline was nothing short of appalling. First, when departing from the Dominican Republic, they did not charge me for a carry-on bag, which was the one positive aspect of my trip. However, they made up for it by charging me simply because their system gave me an error code (404) and I couldn't download my e-ticket. Instead of offering a solution, they charged me for the ""privilege"" of printing a boarding pass. On my return from Medellín, the situation worsened. The flight attendants displayed an astonishing lack of professionalism. They attempted to charge me for a carry-on bag, which clearly fit within their sizing guidelines. I had to insist it was indeed a carry-on. Despite this, they claimed another bag was not ""purchased"" as a carry-on, forcing me to pay triple just to bring a clearly valid bag on board. Absolutely absurd. The attitude of a flight attendant was particularly disturbing—rude, condescending, and giving passengers disdainful looks paired with a hostile tone. Her behavior was not only unprofessional but also incredibly disrespectful. The most shocking incident occurred when I was forced to pay yet again for a carry-on, and this time they wouldn’t accept American Express or even U.S. cash. To add insult to injury, the attendant had the audacity to suggest I leave my bag behind and fly without it! The sheer absurdity of this situation is mind-blowing. The way this airline operates is beyond belief. Passengers are being nickel-and-dimed at every opportunity and subjected to poor treatment because people don't stand up for themselves.

This is not a complaint about the lack of free meals or in-flight entertainment. I know how so-called low cost airlines operate and have never had a problem with any of them until my partner and I tried to fly WOW for the first (and last) time. This is a complaint about the treatment we received and the fees we were charged at the gate of our flight WW447 AMS-KEF, on the date of September 3 at AMS (Schiphol) airport. We booked our WOW air flights months in advance of our flight measured our bags, which fit perfectly within the very restrictive WOW measurements. We have photographs to prove that the bags fit into the bags measurement frame placed at WOW gates. Prior to our flight we checked in online and received boarding passes into email, that was not a problem. However, at the gate of our flight from AMS to KEF we were stopped impolitely by an individual from WOW ground personnel, who started insisting that our bags were carry-ons just because they had 2 wheels, and that we had to pay in order to get them on the plane. She would not even look at my original ticket, where the definition of included luggage only showed dimensions and had in no way specified that included luggage could not have wheels. She never measured the bags, nor weighed them, nothing, just insisted that ""wheels"" cannot be placed under seats due to ""safety."" This individual further refused to provide her name and also prohibited me from taking a photo of her ID for evidence, repeating multiple times that it is not allowed. Every question I tried to ask she dismissed with It is not allowed, to the point that I felt I was talking to a robot. I tried to show her the original ticket on my phone, but she refused to have any human communication or reasoning with me, and kept repeating it is not allowed. When I asked to see a supervisor, she replied, it is not allowed to have a supervisor, after which she moved us to the side and said we were not getting on the flight at all. We had to wait until the entire plane was boarded, when she sent a colleague of hers, who likewise insisted that our small bags were trolleys and were not allowed on the flight for free due to safety. I tried to explain that my original ticket showed no such prohibition whatsoever, but she insisted we had to pay or we could not fly. We absolutely felt blackmailed, humiliated and ended up profoundly disturbed They charged us 160 Euro for our two bags, as we were taking a connect flight to Detroit later that afternoon from Reykjavik, and only then were we allowed to board the flight. Once we paid, however, we were told that we could place our bags wherever we chose, and when I said that the entire affair was not about safety but about paying, they had no response, because this is what it was all about – extorting money from travelers.  If the company wants to prohibit the use of wheeled luggage, it must define the included luggage as such excluding wheels, otherwise am free to interpret the shape or pattern of the luggage freely, as long as it complies with the measurements, which it did.

24030,24030,WOW air,1,"""a huge risk flying this airline""",18th August 2018,True,"  Los Angeles to Reykjavik. The only reason I considered this airline is because it was the only direct flight and they had ""big seats,"" that we could upgrade to so I thought why not. We paid a lot extra to get the biggest seats, plus bags, meals etc. Well, the night before the flight, we check in and they have put us in standard seats with no extra legroom. They have four types of seats and they put us in the very smallest despite us paying several hundred dollars more per ticket for bigger seats. So, I call the customer service line and they just tell me that I will have to file a claim when I get back! So, my husband calls and they move our seats to what they say are bigger seats. Guess what? They were standard seats on the seat map. So, at that gate they start selling our seats that we already paid for as upgrades! So, my husband goes up and tries to find out why they are selling seats we already paid for and they just offer him some other seats that are supposedly XL but they are in the back of the plane. He says, we don't want seats that don't recline. They say they do recline. So, he agrees and they try to charge him again for an upgrade! Guess what? They are regular standard seats and they don't recline and for extra good measure the plug between the seats doesn't work on either row of seats that they put us in. This was on an overnight flight with my 8-year-old daughter. So, it comes to our return flight - same scenario. They put us in regular standard seats. We called the night before and my husband paid for another upgrade even though we already purchased their highest tier because he doesn't want to argue with them, we just wanted better seats. So, they move our seats, but when we get to the airport, they put us back in the regular standard seats! So, we spent the entire 3 hours at the airport trying to get better seats by talking to 3 different service desks, to no avail. We tell the crew when we get on the plane in case they have any extra decent seats and they offer us one free water. Plugs don't work on this flight either. Every single person we dealt with told us our seats were XL until I showed them the seat map and they will charge you for upgrades in seats that aren't upgrades at all. Everyone just said you'll have to file a claim. Guess what. When I filed a claim when we got back, they declined it and said that we had to contact customer service. Customer Service claimed that they don't deal with refunds. His message told me that I would have to go through an airline rights group. So, they basically tried to steal our money and make it as difficult as possible to get some of our money back. We never got our meals that we paid for or our seats. You are taking a huge risk flying this airline because even if they cancel your flight, you might not get your money back based on their customer service practices of denying legitimate claims.

If you are not Asian or don't like Asian food - please pack your own food. Found this airline to be just as professional, efficient, and friendly to fly with. Our flight did have to go thru 2 Chinese ports of entry (Qingdao & Xiamen). The flight was very comfortable due to the new airplane (Boeing 787-9). I noticed the increased air pressure (6000 ft elevation) and increased humidity did not dry me out and felt good at the end of 14 hours in flight. The flight staff was very courteous, attentive, and tried their best with English but Google translate came in handy to communicate. Wifi was available but not very good - too many people using it and not enough bandwidth for streaming. Food was good - 2 hot meals and 2 cold snacks in-between kept you full and satisfied. Very Chinese cuisines on all 4 legs of the flight (2 international, 2 domestic). Just remember, the airline is Chinese and therefore will serve Chinese food - don't expect Panda Express type food like the US. The food is primarily pork based with some fish, chicken or beef offering. If you elect vegetarian or muslim or any other special needs food, make sure you request this 24 hours before your flight. I saw some western folks unhappy with seeing unfamiliar Chinese food being served on a Chinese airline - I had to chuckle watching them eat the bread and desert for their meals. The only issue which is not the airline's fault was going thru Chinese immigration. We did not have a Chinese visa which is normally required for landing in China, but 50+ countries can ""transit"" thru China if you can prove your final destination is outside of China. The government issues a temporary transit visa for those that are going thru the country - it's good for 24 hours. At our 2 hr layover for refueling, Qingdao was the worst - they scrutinized and held up the entire non Chinese group of passengers looking for errors & past problems. They pulled 2 passengers out of the group for failing to register with a local Chinese police agency the last time they were in China. Military uniformed people surrounded them making you feel like you are in a communist country.... The airline staff was very good at preparing you for Chinese immigration - having your itinerary with you, boarding pass with correct name spelled, etc. Landing at Xiamen was much easier and nicer immigration folks. We even had time to visit the First class airport lounge using our Amex Plat card. Return trip was good and we even had an overnight layover and the airline provided a hotel for the night at no cost which was nice. We did have to pay the taxi rides both ways so remember to bring some Chinese Yuan (RMB) currency. We got to also go on a tour of the city on a double decker sightseeing bus that took us all around the perimeter of the island.

24140,24140,XL Airways France,1,"""will not fly with them again""",11th August 2019,False,"  My family and I traveled this summer from Austin to Miami, two cities in Colombia, Madrid, France, and New York. We used multiple airlines and took carry-on bags on all of them. We are a family of four, and each of us took a carry-on suitcase. The bags qualified for carrying on in all of the airlines that we used, except for this one. Ridiculous enough, the trip that we used XL airways was an international trip from Paris to New York. At the airport, XL airways had a small compartment to measure the bags that they said the bag needed to fit in, including the wheels. It seems like they were doing this scam often enough because when we were boarding there were three guys ready to take ""the bags that people couldn't take as carry-ons"" in the plane. The representative told us that it was going to be $100 euros per bag and they took our passports and put us aside with many other people who were going through the same thing we were going through. They pretty much kept us until everyone boarded and told us that if we were going to take the flight, we needed to pay 65 euros per bag and he acted like he was doing us a favor. This was our flight to come home from a long trip, it was really late at night, and we had our six and nine year old exhausted kids with us, so we didn't see any other option than to pay them for the four bags. This is what they have on their website to pay for checked in bags. Also, during boarding time I have never seen an airline as disorganized as this one. There were no lines and they just called everyone at once. Inside the plane, there was no entertainment and the plane inside was very uncomfortable for a trans-atlantic trip. The only bright spot was that the crew was really nice to us, and they served one hot meal during the flight. Do not fly with this airline, they are not worth it, and if it is a family trip, even worse. Here are the measurements that most airlines advertise as carry on: 22 x 14 x 9 in And here is theirs: 21.7 in high X 13.8 in wide X 9.8 in deep. They are not really that much different. We had measured them before we left for the airport, as well as had carried them on several flights previously. I think what they do with the carry-ons is a scam, I will not recommend this airline to any of my colleagues, family or friends who travel quite often.

I did a ton of research and looked for reviews and couldn't really find reviews base off the experience of their airline. Some of these reviews for XL I feel are from people that expected too much for a budget airline. I read the instructions and recommendations from their website, which I would read entirely to help you have a better experience. When I arrived at the airport I had my boarding pass printed before hand and was quickly greeted by an XL employee. They checked my passport and they checked the weight and size of my luggage. I had to check my luggage in the system, because the weight was too high. Upon boarding I was greeted by a very professional and flight attendants who spoke English and French. They realized I didn't speak French and directed me to my seat. Upon departing they did the standard procedures in French and English for departure. During the flight they provided a blanket, earplugs, water and a free meal! This is a very French airline and the food was very French and flavorful. They were very accommodating for refills of water, tea, and coffee that were free. The airplane itself is older so there is no WIFI onboard for internet. I was not disappointed, because they did provide a free movie and I also had my IPad. I would recommend you take a portable charger for your phone, tablet, or laptop. There are not electrical plugs on the seats for your electronic devices. Throughout the trip the flight attendants were on point and made sure the restrooms were cleaned and that passengers were comfortable.

If you are tempted to fly with this airline because of the wonderful price do not do it. The flight out to Paris was wonderful. The plane was empty so everyone had their own row to relax. The troubles didn't start until we arrived in Paris. On our flight to Paris they lost our babies car seat. When we went to check in today the lady at the counter was rude and unfriendly. We handed her 5 passports. Three for adults and two children. We had 4 bags to check in a stroller and we had our 2 year olds car seat. We have a double stroller. I was holding our ten month old and our two year old was sleeping in the stroller. In San Francisco they put stickers on all three pieces because the stroller breaks down into three pieces. When we told her that the stroller did that she rolled her eyes and said really. Then we tried to check in our two year olds car seat she said nope you can't take it, or you have to pay for it. When I explained they hadn't charged us for it in San Francisco she said well that is San Francisco. She then called the airline and they said we had to pay 50€ for the seat. She told us we had to go to a separate counter to pay then come back to her. As we were leaving she said wait let me put the stickers on the stroller. As she was putting the sticker on one of the pieces she noticed our daughter and said oh you have another child, we said yes, you have her passport to which she then said oh you don't have to pay anymore. Instead of apologizing she just said your finished. We upgraded to seats 4 thinking they would be wonderful seats because of our previous flight. But the seats had less space than before! They were so uncomfortable! Especially having a twenty pound baby on your lap. There was a section in front of us nobody knew was available. When I finally got the attention again of a stewardess the doors were being closed and she said that I needed to go to the gate to pay. What kind of airline charges for everything other than water, coffee and tea but wont let you buy up a seat? There were 8 seats open! Those seats remained open all flight. Our ten month old was walking back and forth in front of our seats holding onto the seats. We didn't notice but there was an ashtray in our daughters seat. In it was trash with liquid and food. It stuck and was disgusting. Our son put his hand in it. When I asked the stewardess to do something about it, she said you think it's my problem? I said to her I am not saying you own the airplane but you are the only one who's really able to do anything because you have the access to things to clean it. She rolled her eyes at me. 6 minutes later another stewardess came with gloves and took out the trash and in the process got liquid on us and said there I got everything. She went and got a napkin dabbed and said there I am done and walked away. 6th thing, for a couple hours service was non existent. We were trying to make a bottle for our ten month old so he could sleep and we pushed the service button but nobody came for 30 minutes.

This is so inflexible. And the staff still nag that I got too many hand carry. Boarding pass can only be obtain via Kiosk and no sign to direct u to use them. customer service is really bad.  This airline really need to look into their customer service at Narita. I am not taking this lousy airline to Japan with this kind of service and attitude. The worst is after boarding there are many that didn’t checked in their luggage I don’t think their luggage can weight less than 7kg so why am I forced to check in because I paid for a check in baggage when I purchase the ticket.

24298,24298,ZIPAIR,1,"""being periodically harassed and ridiculed""",19th September 2023,True,"  My review lays with being periodically harassed and ridiculed about an extension seat belt. Being that I am a plus size woman, I already came prepared and brought/bought my own seat belt extender that fit and connected the first flight to Narita no issues about the seat belt extender, however, there were still multiple times of being awaken out my sleep to pull an arm rest down or not have anything in my lap. Back to the initial complaint, on flight ZG026 to San Francisco on 9/18/23. I got to my seat and I over heard the flight attendants that did not wear name badges, speaking in Japanese about of have to make sure the fat lady has a seat belt extender. This the behavior you allow for your company. Then one comes up to me and pulls the seat belt and extends it then says you need an extender. Not ask but stated that I needed one. Still remaining calm I told her I already have one of my own and proceed to click it to get her smoothly. She leaves and talk with the previous attendant that was talking bad about me and comes back saying it’s not safe for me to use my own seatbelt extender belt. Then shoves theirs in my hand and says be sure to give this back at the end of flight and stayed until I removed mine and connected theirs to the seat belt. The attendant walks off says something else that I could not fully hear but definitely heard I’m going to mark her seat down so she doesn’t steals it to the previous attendant they both laugh. I proceeded to state I really don’t need this extension belt and you two are making me uncomfortable and we haven’t even taken off. They lie and says it’s policy and then walk off. Fast forward to 2/3 of the flight nearly ending the same attendant wakes me out of my sleep to tell me don’t forget to leave the extension belt in the seat when I leave. I calmly say ok even though I am boiling because of the assumption of assuming that I’m going to steal a extension belt extender, then when we land and the seatbelt light is off. I took off the seat belt and detached everything and left in the seat. The same harassing attendant comes up to me and demands I give her the seatbelt extender. I reach behind me and get it for her and said I thought you wanted me to leave it in the seat but please do take note that you have it back in your hands. Because I am not a thief and do not appreciate being harassed like one. I wish they had name plates so I can post it in this review. Lounge in narita was ok, the white seats are extremely stained and there’s no restroom inside it.
